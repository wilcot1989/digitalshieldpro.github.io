## Hey, I'm James

I'm James Mitchell, a cybersecurity analyst with 8 years of experience in IT security. I started my career as a SOC analyst at a managed security provider, where I spent my days monitoring threats, responding to incidents, and learning exactly how cybercriminals operate.

That experience changed how I think about digital security. Most people don't need enterprise-grade tools — but they do need the right ones. That's why I started Digital Shield Pro.

## What I Do Here

I test every product I write about. When I review a VPN, I run it on my own devices for weeks. When I compare antivirus software, I put it through real-world scenarios. My home network is basically a testing lab at this point.

Every recommendation on this site comes from actual experience. I don't copy spec sheets or rewrite press releases. If a product isn't worth your money, I'll tell you.

## My Testing Setup

- 1 Gbps fiber connection (Amsterdam, Netherlands)
- Windows 11, macOS Sonoma, Android 15, iOS 18
- Dedicated test machines for malware and phishing simulations
- Speed testing via Ookla, iPerf3, and custom scripts
- Privacy leak testing (DNS, WebRTC, IPv6)

## How This Site Makes Money

I believe in full transparency. Digital Shield Pro earns money through affiliate commissions — when you buy a product through my links, I get a small cut. Here's what that means:

- You pay the same price (often less with my exclusive deals)
- I earn a commission from the provider
- This funds my testing and keeps the site free
- I never recommend products I wouldn't use myself
- Affiliate relationships never influence my ratings

If I think a product is bad, I'll say so — even if they offer a high commission.
