Let's be blunt: **most free VPNs are not safe.** Many of them exist specifically to harvest your data, inject ads, or worse. The very tool you're downloading to protect your privacy may be the biggest threat to it.

But that doesn't mean every free VPN is a scam. A small number of reputable companies offer genuinely useful free tiers — usually as a gateway to their paid plans. These are the ones worth your time.

We spent over three weeks testing 23 free VPN services across Windows, macOS, Android, and iOS. We checked for DNS leaks, WebRTC leaks, malware, data collection practices, speed, and real-world usability. Most failed. Five made the cut.

**If you're in a hurry:** <a href="https://protonvpn.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ProtonVPN Free</a> is the best free VPN in 2026 — it's the only one offering unlimited data with a genuine no-logs policy. But if you need full features (streaming, faster speeds, more servers), a budget paid VPN like [NordVPN](/posts/nordvpn-review-2026/) or [Surfshark](/posts/surfshark-review-2026/) is a much better investment. We explain why below.

## Why Most Free VPNs Are Dangerous

Before we get to the safe options, you need to understand why we're so cautious. Running a VPN service is expensive. Servers, bandwidth, engineering, legal compliance — it all costs money. When a company offers a completely free VPN with no clear revenue model, the question you should ask is: **how are they making money?**

The answer is almost always *you*.

### The Real Cost of "Free" VPNs

**1. Selling your browsing data.** This is the most common revenue model for free VPNs. They log every website you visit, every search you make, and every app you use — then sell that data to advertising networks and data brokers. A 2024 study by Top10VPN found that over 80% of free VPN apps on the Google Play Store had at least one risky permission related to data collection. That number hasn't improved in 2026.

**2. Injecting ads and trackers.** Some free VPNs inject advertisements directly into your web browsing session, or add tracking cookies to your browser. You think you're browsing privately, but your VPN provider is building a detailed profile of your online behavior.

**3. Malware and spyware.** This is the worst-case scenario, and it happens more often than you'd think. Security researchers have found that several popular free VPN apps contained malware, including keystroke loggers, cryptocurrency miners, and trojans. If you download a free VPN from an unknown developer, you are gambling with your device's security.

**4. Selling your bandwidth.** Some free VPNs use your internet connection as an exit node for other users — or worse, sell your bandwidth to botnets. Hola VPN was famously caught doing exactly this. Your IP address could be used for activities you have no knowledge of.

**5. DNS and IP leaks.** Many free VPNs simply don't work properly. They claim to hide your IP address, but in reality, DNS leaks and WebRTC leaks expose your true location. This gives you a false sense of security while providing no actual protection.

**6. Weak or outdated encryption.** Budget constraints mean some free VPNs use outdated encryption protocols — or no real encryption at all. A "VPN" that doesn't properly encrypt your traffic is just a fancy proxy that slows down your internet.

> **The bottom line:** If you're going to use a free VPN, you must choose very carefully. The five services below are the exceptions, not the rule. For our complete guide to paid VPNs, see our [Best VPN Services in 2026](/posts/best-vpn-services-2026/) comparison.

## Our Testing Methodology

We take free VPN testing seriously. Here's exactly what we evaluate:

**Privacy & Security Testing**
- DNS leak tests (using dnsleaktest.com and browserleaks.com)
- WebRTC leak tests
- IPv6 leak tests
- Encryption verification (packet inspection via Wireshark)
- Privacy policy analysis (by a human, not a summary)
- Jurisdiction and parent company research

**Performance Testing**
- Speed tests on a 1 Gbps fiber connection (Amsterdam, Netherlands)
- Speed tests repeated three times per server, averaged
- Latency measurements
- Connection stability over 24-hour periods

**Usability Testing**
- App quality on Windows, macOS, Android, and iOS
- Ease of setup and connection
- Data cap tracking (where applicable)
- Feature comparison vs. the paid tier

**Streaming & Access**
- Netflix, YouTube, BBC iPlayer, Disney+ access tests
- Geo-restriction bypass capability

We tested all 23 free VPNs between January and February 2026. Only five passed our minimum standards for security, privacy, and usability. For a step-by-step guide on getting any of these set up, check our [How to Set Up a VPN in 2026](/posts/how-to-set-up-vpn-2026/) guide.

## 1. ProtonVPN Free — Best Free VPN Overall

<div class="rating">8.5/10</div>

**ProtonVPN Free is the gold standard for free VPNs**, and it's not particularly close. It's the only reputable free VPN that offers truly unlimited data — no monthly cap, no daily cap, no throttling after a certain threshold.

ProtonVPN is made by the same Swiss company behind ProtonMail, one of the most respected encrypted email providers in the world. Their commitment to privacy is not marketing fluff — it's baked into their corporate DNA. Switzerland has some of the strongest privacy laws in the world, and Proton Technologies has a track record of fighting for user privacy, including resisting government data requests.

### What You Get for Free

- **Unlimited data** — No cap whatsoever
- **Servers in 5 countries** — United States, Netherlands, Japan, Romania, and Poland
- **Strong encryption** — AES-256, same as the paid tier
- **No-logs policy** — Independently audited and verified
- **No ads** — Proton does not serve ads or sell data
- **Apps for all platforms** — Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS
- **Kill switch** — Prevents data leaks if the VPN drops

### What You Don't Get

- **Limited server locations** — 5 countries vs. 90+ on the paid plan
- **Single device connection** — Only 1 device at a time
- **Lower priority speeds** — Free users get lower priority than paid subscribers, so speeds are noticeably slower during peak hours
- **No streaming support** — Free servers are blocked by Netflix, Disney+, and most other streaming platforms
- **No Secure Core** — The advanced multi-hop routing feature is paid-only
- **No P2P/torrenting** — File sharing is blocked on free servers

### Speed Test Results

| Server Location | Download | Upload | Latency |
|----------------|----------|--------|---------|
| **Netherlands** (local) | 95 Mbps | 42 Mbps | 12 ms |
| **United States** | 45 Mbps | 18 Mbps | 110 ms |
| **Japan** | 32 Mbps | 14 Mbps | 245 ms |

These speeds are perfectly adequate for web browsing, email, social media, and standard-definition video. They won't support smooth 4K streaming, and download speeds for large files will feel slow compared to paid VPNs. But for basic privacy protection, ProtonVPN Free delivers.

### Privacy Assessment

ProtonVPN passed every privacy test we ran:
- Zero DNS leaks detected
- Zero WebRTC leaks detected
- Zero IPv6 leaks detected
- No trackers in the app
- No third-party analytics libraries

Their no-logs policy has been independently audited by Securitum, and Proton publishes regular transparency reports. This is a company you can genuinely trust with your data.

### Who Should Use ProtonVPN Free?

ProtonVPN Free is ideal if you need a VPN for **everyday privacy protection** — securing your connection on public Wi-Fi, preventing your ISP from snooping on your browsing, or adding a basic layer of anonymity. It's not suitable for streaming geo-restricted content, torrenting, or anything requiring fast speeds.

## 2. Windscribe Free — Best Free VPN for Features

<div class="rating">8.0/10</div>

Windscribe's free tier is remarkably generous in terms of features. While you're limited to 10 GB of data per month, the features you get within that cap rival many paid VPN services.

Windscribe is a Canadian company that has built a solid reputation in the VPN space. Their free plan isn't just a stripped-down demo — it includes their ad blocker (R.O.B.E.R.T.), split tunneling, and access to servers in 11 countries.

### What You Get for Free

- **10 GB per month** — Enough for moderate browsing (you can earn 5 GB more by tweeting about Windscribe)
- **Servers in 11 countries** — US, Canada, UK, France, Germany, Netherlands, Norway, Romania, Switzerland, Hong Kong, Turkey
- **R.O.B.E.R.T. ad blocker** — Blocks ads, malware, trackers, and more at the DNS level
- **Strong encryption** — AES-256 with WireGuard, OpenVPN, or IKEv2
- **Firewall (kill switch)** — Prevents leaks if the connection drops
- **Split tunneling** — Choose which apps use the VPN
- **Browser extensions** — Chrome, Firefox, and Edge extensions included

### What You Don't Get

- **10 GB monthly cap** — This is the main limitation; heavy users will hit it quickly
- **No unlimited connections** — Limited to 1 device at a time on the free plan
- **Slower speeds during peak hours** — Paid users get priority
- **No dedicated streaming servers** — Streaming access is hit-or-miss

### Speed Test Results

| Server Location | Download | Upload | Latency |
|----------------|----------|--------|---------|
| **Netherlands** (local) | 120 Mbps | 55 Mbps | 8 ms |
| **United States** | 65 Mbps | 28 Mbps | 95 ms |
| **United Kingdom** | 110 Mbps | 48 Mbps | 15 ms |

Windscribe's free servers are noticeably faster than ProtonVPN's, which makes sense — they limit your data instead of your speed. If you have a specific short-term task that needs decent speed, Windscribe is a better choice.

### Privacy Assessment

Windscribe passed all our leak tests. Their privacy policy is straightforward: they log the total amount of bandwidth used in a 30-day period (to enforce the cap) and the timestamp of your last connection. They do **not** log which sites you visit, your IP address, or any session data. This is a reasonable and transparent policy for a free service.

One consideration: Windscribe is based in Canada, which is a Five Eyes country. This is a step down from ProtonVPN's Swiss jurisdiction, though Windscribe's minimal logging policy means there's very little data to hand over even if compelled.

### Who Should Use Windscribe Free?

Windscribe Free is ideal if you need a VPN **occasionally** — maybe a few times a week for public Wi-Fi security, or for a specific task that requires a different IP address. The 10 GB cap makes it impractical as a daily driver, but the feature set and speed are excellent within that limit.

## 3. hide.me Free — Best Free VPN for Privacy

<div class="rating">7.5/10</div>

hide.me is a Malaysian-based VPN provider that has been quietly building one of the more trustworthy free VPN offerings. It's not as well-known as ProtonVPN or Windscribe, but its privacy credentials are solid.

### What You Get for Free

- **10 GB per month** — Same as Windscribe
- **Servers in 8 countries** — US (East & West), Canada, UK, Netherlands, Germany, France, Singapore
- **No-logs policy** — Independently audited
- **Strong encryption** — WireGuard, OpenVPN, IKEv2, and SoftEther supported
- **Kill switch** — Available on all platforms
- **No ads** — The free tier does not serve ads
- **1 device connection** at a time

### What You Don't Get

- **10 GB monthly cap** — Same limitation as Windscribe
- **No streaming unblocking** — Free servers don't bypass geo-restrictions
- **Fewer server locations** — 8 countries vs. 80+ on the paid plan
- **No split tunneling on free** — This is a paid feature
- **Single device only** — Paid plan supports 10 simultaneous connections

### Speed Test Results

| Server Location | Download | Upload | Latency |
|----------------|----------|--------|---------|
| **Netherlands** (local) | 105 Mbps | 50 Mbps | 10 ms |
| **United States (East)** | 55 Mbps | 22 Mbps | 100 ms |
| **Singapore** | 42 Mbps | 15 Mbps | 180 ms |

Decent performance that sits between ProtonVPN and Windscribe. More than enough for regular browsing and email within the data cap.

### Privacy Assessment

hide.me passed all our leak tests cleanly. The company has undergone independent security audits and publishes a warrant canary. Being based in Malaysia (which has no mandatory data retention laws) is actually a privacy advantage — it's outside the Five Eyes, Nine Eyes, and Fourteen Eyes surveillance alliances.

Their privacy policy is clear and specific about what they don't log: no connection logs, no activity logs, no IP addresses, no timestamps. Among free VPNs, this is one of the strongest privacy positions available.

### Who Should Use hide.me Free?

hide.me Free is a solid choice for privacy-conscious users who want a trustworthy VPN for occasional use. If you value privacy jurisdiction and audited no-logs policies, and you don't need unlimited data, hide.me deserves serious consideration.

## 4. Hotspot Shield Free — Fastest Free VPN (With Caveats)

<div class="rating">6.5/10</div>

Hotspot Shield's free tier has one clear advantage: it's fast. Their proprietary Catapult Hydra protocol consistently delivers higher speeds than competitors. But this speed comes at a cost — the free version is ad-supported and has a 500 MB daily data cap.

### What You Get for Free

- **500 MB per day** (~15 GB/month) — Resets daily, which is slightly more generous than a flat monthly cap
- **1 server location** — United States only
- **Catapult Hydra protocol** — Proprietary protocol that delivers fast speeds
- **Basic encryption** — AES-128 (not AES-256 like the paid tier and our other picks)
- **Apps for all major platforms**

### What You Don't Get

- **Ad-supported** — You will see ads, and the app collects data for ad targeting
- **Only US servers** — No location choice
- **Weaker encryption** — AES-128 instead of AES-256
- **Limited privacy** — The free tier collects more data than we'd like (see below)
- **No kill switch on free** — This is a paid feature
- **No streaming** — Netflix and other platforms are blocked
- **1 device** at a time

### Speed Test Results

| Server Location | Download | Upload | Latency |
|----------------|----------|--------|---------|
| **United States** (from NL) | 130 Mbps | 55 Mbps | 90 ms |

That's notably faster than every other free VPN on this list. If raw speed is your priority and you're okay with the limitations, Hotspot Shield delivers.

### Privacy Assessment — Why the Lower Rating

Here's where Hotspot Shield's free tier falls short. The app collects data for advertising purposes, including your approximate location, device information, and browsing activity (in aggregate). Their privacy policy is significantly more permissive than ProtonVPN's, Windscribe's, or hide.me's.

Hotspot Shield did pass our DNS and WebRTC leak tests, so your IP address is protected. But the data collection for ad targeting is a meaningful trade-off. You're not exposed to third-party threats, but the VPN provider itself is collecting data about you.

Additionally, the use of AES-128 encryption (instead of the industry-standard AES-256) is not ideal. AES-128 is still considered secure, but there's no good reason not to use AES-256 in 2026.

### Who Should Use Hotspot Shield Free?

Hotspot Shield Free is best for users who need **fast speeds for a specific short-term task** and don't mind the ad-supported model. It's not our recommendation for privacy-focused users. If privacy is your goal, ProtonVPN or hide.me are better choices.

## 5. Atlas VPN Free — Basic Protection From a Trusted Parent Company

<div class="rating">6.5/10</div>

Atlas VPN is owned by Nord Security — the same company behind [NordVPN](/posts/nordvpn-review-2026/). This parentage gives it a credibility boost, though the free tier itself is quite limited.

### What You Get for Free

- **5 GB per month** — The smallest cap on our list
- **Servers in 3 countries** — US, Netherlands, and one rotating location
- **WireGuard protocol** — Modern, fast, and secure
- **AES-256 encryption** — Full-strength encryption
- **No-logs policy** — Backed by Nord Security's reputation
- **Tracker blocker** — Basic ad and tracker blocking included
- **Available on all major platforms**

### What You Don't Get

- **Only 5 GB per month** — Very limited; you'll use this up quickly
- **Very few server options** — 3 countries is minimal
- **No streaming support** — Free servers are blocked by streaming platforms
- **2 device limit** — Can connect 2 devices simultaneously (better than some competitors)
- **No advanced features** — No split tunneling, MultiHop, or dedicated IP on the free plan

### Speed Test Results

| Server Location | Download | Upload | Latency |
|----------------|----------|--------|---------|
| **Netherlands** (local) | 85 Mbps | 38 Mbps | 14 ms |
| **United States** | 40 Mbps | 16 Mbps | 115 ms |

Middling speeds — nothing impressive, but serviceable for basic tasks. The WireGuard protocol helps keep things snappy.

### Privacy Assessment

Being under the Nord Security umbrella is a plus. Atlas VPN benefits from Nord's infrastructure and privacy commitments. The no-logs policy is credible, and the app passed our leak tests. However, Atlas VPN as a standalone product hasn't undergone the same level of independent auditing as ProtonVPN or NordVPN itself.

### Who Should Use Atlas VPN Free?

Atlas VPN Free is a reasonable choice if you want a simple, trustworthy VPN for **very occasional use** — maybe a few times a month when you connect to public Wi-Fi. The 5 GB cap is its main drawback. If you find yourself wanting more, the natural upgrade path leads to NordVPN, which is a strong selling point.

## Free VPNs You Should Absolutely Avoid

Not all free VPNs are created equal. The following services have documented histories of shady behavior, and we strongly recommend staying away from them.

### Hola VPN

Hola is a peer-to-peer VPN, which means your internet connection is used as an exit node for other users' traffic. In 2015, it was revealed that Hola's parent company, Luminati (now Bright Data), was selling users' bandwidth to anyone willing to pay — including botnet operators. Your IP address could be used for DDoS attacks, spam, or illegal content access. Despite widespread coverage of this issue, Hola remains popular because it's easy to use and markets itself aggressively. **Avoid at all costs.**

### SuperVPN

SuperVPN has been flagged by multiple security researchers for critical vulnerabilities and potential malware. In 2021, a database containing the personal data of 21 million SuperVPN users was found for sale on hacker forums. The data included email addresses, device information, and payment details. The app has been removed from the Google Play Store multiple times, only to reappear. **Do not install this app.**

### VPN Master / Turbo VPN / Snap VPN

These apps (and dozens like them) are developed by companies based in mainland China with no transparent ownership structure. Security researchers have found excessive permissions, embedded trackers, and data being sent to servers in China. There's no credible privacy policy, no audit history, and no accountability. **Stay far away from any VPN with a generic name and no clear company behind it.**

### Betternet

Betternet's business model is built on advertising. A study found their Android app contained 14 tracking libraries — the highest number among all VPN apps tested at the time. They also use third-party SDKs that inject ads into your browsing sessions. The VPN technically works, but you're paying with your data and your attention.

### Touch VPN

Owned by Aura (formerly Pango), Touch VPN logs significant amounts of user data, including your IP address, the websites you visit, and the duration of your sessions. Their privacy policy is vague enough to allow sharing this data with third parties. For a VPN that's supposed to protect your privacy, this is unacceptable.

> **Our rule of thumb:** If a free VPN isn't on our recommended list above, don't use it. The risk is simply not worth the reward when safe alternatives exist. If you need more than what the free options provide, a cheap paid VPN is a much smarter investment.

---

## Why a Cheap Paid VPN Is Better Than Any Free VPN

We've been honest about the free options on this list — they're the best of a limited category. But even the best free VPN has significant limitations that a paid VPN eliminates entirely. Let's be direct about what you gain by spending a few dollars per month.

### The Limitations of Free VPNs

| Limitation | Free VPN Reality | Paid VPN Reality |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Data caps** | 0-10 GB/month (ProtonVPN is the exception) | Unlimited |
| **Servers** | 3-11 countries | 90-111 countries |
| **Speed** | 40-130 Mbps | 700-940 Mbps |
| **Streaming** | Blocked by Netflix, Disney+, etc. | Full access to all major platforms |
| **Simultaneous devices** | 1-2 | 6-10 (unlimited with Surfshark) |
| **Torrenting** | Usually blocked | Full P2P support |
| **Customer support** | Email only, slow | 24/7 live chat |
| **Advanced features** | Basic | Split tunneling, MultiHop, ad blocking, etc. |

The gap is massive. A free VPN protects your basic privacy on a single device with moderate speed. A paid VPN protects your entire digital life across all devices with full speed and full access.

### NordVPN — The Best Overall VPN

NordVPN is our [top-rated VPN for 2026](/posts/best-vpn-services-2026/). At $3.49/month on the 2-year plan, it costs less than a cup of coffee and gives you:

- **6,400+ servers in 111 countries** — vs. 5 countries on ProtonVPN Free
- **Speeds up to 940 Mbps** — vs. 95 Mbps on ProtonVPN Free
- **Works with Netflix, Disney+, BBC iPlayer, and more** — vs. no streaming on free VPNs
- **10 simultaneous connections** — vs. 1 on most free plans
- **Threat Protection Pro** — Built-in ad, tracker, and malware blocker
- **Double VPN, Onion over VPN, Meshnet** — Advanced privacy features
- **Independently audited no-logs policy** — By Deloitte
- **24/7 live chat support**
- **30-day money-back guarantee** — Try it risk-free

### Surfshark — Best Budget Paid VPN

If even NordVPN's price feels steep, Surfshark delivers outstanding value at just $2.29/month. That's less than $28 per year for:

- **3,200+ servers in 100 countries**
- **Unlimited simultaneous connections** — Cover every device in your household
- **CleanWeb ad blocker** — Blocks ads, trackers, and malware
- **Strong speeds** — Up to 780 Mbps in our testing

- **MultiHop and Camouflage Mode** — Advanced privacy tools
- **No-logs policy** — Independently audited
- **30-day money-back guarantee**

### The Math Is Simple

Let's put it this way. ProtonVPN Free gives you unlimited data on 5 server locations at moderate speeds on 1 device. Surfshark gives you unlimited everything — data, devices, servers, speed, streaming — for $2.29 per month.

That's **7.6 cents per day** for complete, unrestricted VPN protection across your phone, laptop, tablet, smart TV, and router. There is no free VPN in existence that competes with that.

If you're currently relying on a free VPN as your primary privacy tool, upgrading to NordVPN or Surfshark is one of the highest-impact, lowest-cost security improvements you can make. Both offer 30-day money-back guarantees, so you can try them risk-free.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is it safe to use a free VPN?

It depends entirely on which free VPN you choose. The five services on our list — ProtonVPN Free, Windscribe Free, hide.me Free, Hotspot Shield Free, and Atlas VPN Free — are safe to use. They come from reputable companies with transparent business practices. However, the vast majority of free VPNs on app stores are not safe and may actively harm your privacy. Stick to our recommendations or use a [paid VPN](/posts/best-vpn-services-2026/) for the best protection.

### Can I use a free VPN for Netflix?

In most cases, no. Netflix and other streaming platforms actively block VPN IP addresses, and free VPN servers are among the first to be detected and blacklisted. ProtonVPN Free, Windscribe Free, and the other services on this list do not reliably unblock Netflix. If streaming is your primary use case, you need a paid VPN. NordVPN and Surfshark both offer excellent [streaming capabilities](/posts/best-vpn-for-streaming-2026/) and consistently unblock Netflix, Disney+, BBC iPlayer, and more.

### What is the best free VPN with unlimited data?

ProtonVPN Free is the only reputable free VPN that offers unlimited data. Every other trustworthy free VPN imposes a monthly data cap (typically 5-10 GB). Be cautious of any other "unlimited free VPN" — if it sounds too good to be true, it almost certainly is. These services are likely monetizing your data instead.

### Are free VPNs slower than paid VPNs?

Yes, significantly. In our testing, the fastest free VPN (Hotspot Shield) topped out at 130 Mbps, while NordVPN reached 940 Mbps. Free VPN users typically get lower priority on shared servers, and the limited number of free servers means more congestion. For everyday browsing and email, free VPN speeds are usually adequate. For streaming, gaming, or downloading large files, you'll notice the difference.

### Can I use a free VPN for torrenting?

Most free VPNs explicitly block torrenting (P2P) traffic, and the ones that don't usually have data caps that make torrenting impractical. ProtonVPN Free blocks P2P entirely. Windscribe Free allows it but with a 10 GB monthly cap. If you need a VPN for torrenting, a paid service with dedicated P2P servers — like [NordVPN](/posts/nordvpn-review-2026/) or [Surfshark](/posts/surfshark-review-2026/) — is the practical choice.

### Is ProtonVPN Free really free forever?

Yes. ProtonVPN's free tier is a permanent offering, not a time-limited trial. You can create a free account and use it indefinitely. Proton's business model relies on converting free users to paid subscribers — they don't need to charge you or sell your data. The free tier has limitations (fewer servers, lower speeds, single device), but there's no catch and no time limit.

### Should I use a free VPN or no VPN at all?

If your choice is between a reputable free VPN (like ProtonVPN Free) and no VPN at all, using the free VPN is better — especially on public Wi-Fi networks. Any encryption is better than no encryption. However, if your choice is between a sketchy, unknown free VPN and no VPN, go with no VPN. An untrustworthy VPN is worse than no VPN because it can actively compromise your security while giving you a false sense of protection.

### How do free VPNs make money?

Legitimate free VPNs like ProtonVPN, Windscribe, and hide.me make money by converting free users to paid subscribers. The free tier is a marketing tool — it lets you try the service, and the company bets that enough users will upgrade to fund the free tier. Less legitimate free VPNs make money by selling user data, injecting ads, or selling bandwidth. This is why choosing the right free VPN matters so much.

---

## Our Final Recommendation

**If you need a free VPN:** Use <a href="https://protonvpn.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ProtonVPN Free</a>. Unlimited data, Swiss privacy laws, audited no-logs policy, and a company you can trust. It's not perfect — the speed and server selection are limited — but for basic privacy protection, it's the best free option by a comfortable margin.

**If you can afford $2-4 per month:** Skip the free tier entirely and go with a paid VPN. The experience is incomparably better. Our top recommendations are:

1. **NordVPN** ($3.49/mo) — Best overall VPN, fastest speeds, works with everything
2. **Surfshark** ($2.29/mo) — Best value, unlimited devices, excellent features

Both offer 30-day money-back guarantees. Try them, and if they're not worth it, get a refund and fall back to ProtonVPN Free. But we're confident you'll keep them.
