  - q: "How many devices can I use with Surfshark?"
    a: "Surfshark allows unlimited simultaneous connections on a single subscription. You can protect every device in your household without any device limits."
  - q: "Is Surfshark owned by NordVPN?"
    a: "Surfshark and NordVPN are both owned by the same parent company, Nord Security, following a merger completed in 2022. However, both brands continue to operate as independent products with separate server infrastructure and development teams."
  - q: "Does Surfshark work in China?"
    a: "Surfshark's Camouflage mode and NoBorders mode are designed to bypass internet censorship. Reports from users in China indicate it works intermittently on certain servers. Download and configure Surfshark before arriving in China."

I recommend NordVPN as my top VPN pick, but Surfshark is what I tell people when they say "I don't want to spend that much." After running it as my daily driver for over three months -- speed benchmarks, streaming marathons, leak tests, the works -- I can say this: at $2.19/month with unlimited device connections, Surfshark punches well above its weight. But cheap means nothing if the product falls short, and there are a few areas where it does exactly that. Here is my full, honest Surfshark review for 2026.

**On Trustpilot, Surfshark scores a 4.3/5 based on 28,700+ reviews** -- one of the highest-rated VPNs on the platform. Most users praise the value-for-money and ease of use. The recurring complaints? Customer support response times and occasional app connectivity hiccups.

## What Surfshark Actually Costs in 2026 (and How It Compares)

Pricing is where Surfshark pulls ahead of every major competitor. Here is a side-by-side breakdown so you can see exactly what you are paying versus NordVPN and ExpressVPN -- the two services I test it against most often.

### Surfshark Pricing vs. NordVPN vs. ExpressVPN (February 2026)

| | **Surfshark** | **NordVPN** | **ExpressVPN** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1 Month** | $15.45/mo | $12.99/mo | $12.95/mo |
| **1 Year** | $2.99/mo ($35.88 total) | $4.49/mo ($53.88 total) | $9.99/mo ($99.84 total) |
| **2 Years** | **$2.19/mo** ($59.13 total) | **$3.49/mo** ($83.76 total) | **$6.67/mo** ($160.08 total) |
| **Simultaneous Devices** | **Unlimited** | 10 | 8 |
| **Money-Back Guarantee** | 30 days | 30 days | 30 days |
| **Servers** | 3,200+ in 100 countries | 6,400+ in 111 countries | 3,000+ in 105 countries |
| **Trustpilot Score** | **4.3/5** (28,700+ reviews) | 4.2/5 (33,000+ reviews) | 4.4/5 (25,000+ reviews) |

The math is hard to argue with. Over two years, Surfshark costs $59.13 versus NordVPN's $83.76 and ExpressVPN's $160.08. That is a saving of $24 compared to NordVPN and over $100 compared to ExpressVPN. For a family of four where everyone needs VPN protection? Surfshark's unlimited device policy means one $59 subscription covers everyone. With NordVPN, you'd start bumping against that 10-device cap pretty fast.

### Surfshark One and One+ Bundles

Surfshark also offers two upgraded tiers worth mentioning:

- **Surfshark One** ($2.69/mo on the 2-year plan): Adds Surfshark Antivirus, Alert (data breach monitoring), and Search (private search engine).
- **Surfshark One+** ($3.99/mo on the 2-year plan): Everything in One plus Incogni, a personal data removal service that contacts data brokers on your behalf.

The One+ bundle is genuinely interesting. Incogni alone costs around $7/month standalone, so getting it bundled with a VPN, antivirus, and breach alerts at under $4/month is real value. I have been testing the One+ bundle for the past six weeks, and Incogni has already sent removal requests to 47 data brokers on my behalf.

All plans come with a **30-day money-back guarantee**. Payment options include credit cards, PayPal, Google Pay, Amazon Pay, and cryptocurrency via CoinGate (useful if you want to minimize personal info tied to your account).

## Speed Test Results: How Fast Is Surfshark Really?

I ran Surfshark through speed tests over a two-week period from my 500 Mbps fiber connection in Western Europe. All tests used the WireGuard protocol (Surfshark's default and fastest option). Each location was tested five times on different days and averaged.

### Surfshark Speed Benchmarks (WireGuard, February 2026)

| Server Location | Download | Upload | Ping | Speed Retained |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **No VPN (baseline)** | 487 Mbps | 245 Mbps | 8 ms | -- |
| **Netherlands (nearest)** | 441 Mbps | 218 Mbps | 11 ms | 91% |
| **United Kingdom** | 412 Mbps | 195 Mbps | 18 ms | 85% |
| **US East (New York)** | 348 Mbps | 142 Mbps | 82 ms | 71% |
| **US West (Los Angeles)** | 291 Mbps | 118 Mbps | 138 ms | 60% |
| **Australia (Sydney)** | 187 Mbps | 72 Mbps | 268 ms | 38% |
| **Japan (Tokyo)** | 203 Mbps | 81 Mbps | 241 ms | 42% |

**The short version:** Surfshark is fast enough for anything you'll throw at it on nearby and mid-range servers. 441 Mbps on the nearest server with 91% speed retention is excellent -- right up there with NordVPN's NordLynx results. The UK connection at 85% retention is equally solid.

The transatlantic link to New York clocked in at 348 Mbps, which is more than enough for 4K streaming, video calls, and gaming. You will not notice a difference in daily use.

**Where Surfshark falls behind:** long-distance connections to Australia and Japan dropped to 38-42% speed retention. Still perfectly usable at 187-203 Mbps, but NordVPN held 50-55% on these same routes in my [NordVPN review](/posts/nordvpn-review-2026/). If you regularly connect to servers on the other side of the planet, that gap matters. For 95% of users who mainly connect within their own continent? Surfshark's speeds are more than sufficient.

## Security and Privacy: What Surfshark Gets Right (and Wrong)

Security is where a VPN lives or dies. I spent significant time poking at Surfshark's infrastructure, running leak tests, and reviewing their published audit reports. Here is what I found.

### Encryption and Protocols

Surfshark supports three protocols:

- **WireGuard** -- The default. Modern cryptography (ChaCha20, Curve25519, BLAKE2s), roughly 4,000 lines of auditable code versus OpenVPN's 600,000+. I recommend this for almost everyone.
- **OpenVPN (UDP/TCP)** -- The veteran standard with AES-256-GCM encryption. Useful when WireGuard is blocked on certain networks.
- **IKEv2/IPsec** -- Available on iOS and macOS, good for mobile connections that switch between Wi-Fi and cellular.

### RAM-Only Servers

Surfshark's entire 3,200+ server network runs on RAM-only infrastructure. No hard drives, no persistent storage. When a server restarts, everything is wiped. If law enforcement physically seized a server, they'd find nothing. This is the same approach NordVPN and ExpressVPN use, and I consider it table stakes for any serious VPN in 2026.

### No-Logs Policy

Surfshark claims to log nothing -- no browsing activity, no connection timestamps, no IP addresses, no bandwidth data. This was verified by a Deloitte audit in 2023. My honest take: I'd like to see a more recent audit. NordVPN had Deloitte back in 2024, and ExpressVPN brought in KPMG the same year. Surfshark is overdue for a fresh independent review. The RAM-only architecture gives me reasonable confidence, but a 2026 audit would settle the question.

### CleanWeb (Ad and Malware Blocker)

CleanWeb blocks ads, trackers, and malware domains at the DNS level. In my testing, it caught about 78% of test ads and 91% of known malware domains. Not a replacement for a dedicated antivirus, but a solid extra layer -- especially on mobile where browser extensions aren't always practical.

### MultiHop, Camouflage, and NoBorders

Three features that set Surfshark apart from bare-bones VPNs:

- **MultiHop (Double VPN):** Routes traffic through two servers. Since late 2025, you can build custom entry/exit server pairs instead of relying on presets. The trade-off: roughly 40-50% additional speed loss. Use it when you need extra anonymity, not for Netflix.
- **Camouflage Mode:** Disguises VPN traffic as regular HTTPS. I tested it on networks that blocked standard WireGuard and OpenVPN -- it got through. Essential for users in restrictive countries.
- **NoBorders Mode:** Activates automatically on restrictive networks and serves up a curated list of servers optimized for censored environments.

### Kill Switch -- One Honest Concern

The kill switch cuts your internet if the VPN drops, preventing IP leaks. On Windows, macOS, and iOS, it worked flawlessly in my testing. On Android? I encountered two instances where it did not engage fast enough during forced disconnections. Surfshark has acknowledged this and says a fix is in development. If you are on Android and privacy is critical, double-check your kill switch settings and consider running a manual leak test after installation.

### Other Security Features Worth Mentioning

- **IP Rotator:** Periodically changes your IP without disconnecting.
- **Nexus:** Software-defined networking that routes you through a server mesh rather than a single point.
- **Alternative ID:** Generates a burner identity with a proxy email.
- **Bypasser (Split Tunneling):** Choose which apps use the VPN and which don't.

## Streaming and Torrenting: Does Surfshark Actually Unblock Everything?

Let's be real -- most people buy a VPN to watch content they can't access in their country. I tested Surfshark against every major streaming platform across five regions.

### Surfshark Streaming Test Results (February 2026)

| Streaming Service | US | UK | Canada | Australia | Japan |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Netflix | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Disney+ | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | -- |
| Amazon Prime Video | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | -- |
| BBC iPlayer | -- | Yes | -- | -- | -- |
| Hulu | Yes | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| HBO Max | Yes | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| DAZN | Yes | Yes | -- | -- | Yes |
| Peacock | Yes | -- | -- | -- | -- |

**Netflix worked in all five tested regions.** That matters because Netflix has gotten significantly more aggressive with VPN detection, and plenty of cheaper VPNs fail here. I watched full episodes across US, UK, and Japan Netflix libraries without a single mid-stream disconnect or quality drop.

**BBC iPlayer** -- notoriously picky about VPNs -- worked, but only on Surfshark's London servers. The Manchester server was inconsistent. Small detail, but worth knowing.

**One thing I genuinely appreciate:** Surfshark includes Smart DNS for devices that don't support VPN apps natively (smart TVs, game consoles, older Rokus). It won't encrypt your traffic, but it will unblock geo-restricted content without the speed overhead of a full VPN tunnel.

### Torrenting

Surfshark allows P2P on all servers and automatically reroutes you through optimized P2P infrastructure when it detects torrent traffic. I downloaded a 10 GB Linux distribution ISO at an average of 28 MB/s on a nearby European server -- solid performance. The no-logs policy, kill switch, and RAM-only servers make it a reasonable choice for legal torrenting. Just make sure your kill switch is on before you fire up your torrent client.

## Unlimited Devices: Surfshark's Killer Feature

This is the single biggest reason to choose Surfshark over NordVPN or ExpressVPN. While NordVPN caps you at 10 simultaneous connections and ExpressVPN at 8, Surfshark has **no limit whatsoever**.

I tested this by connecting 12 devices simultaneously -- three laptops, four phones, two tablets, a Fire TV Stick, a Chromecast, and a router. Zero performance degradation. Stable connections on all devices. No authentication errors.

### Supported Platforms

- **Desktop:** Windows, macOS, Linux (full GUI -- not just a command-line tool)
- **Mobile:** iOS, Android
- **Browser Extensions:** Chrome, Firefox, Edge
- **Smart TVs:** Android TV, Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV (tvOS 17+)
- **Gaming Consoles:** Via router or Smart DNS
- **Routers:** DD-WRT, Tomato, OpenWrt compatible

The Linux GUI app deserves a callout. Most VPN providers give Linux users a command-line tool and call it a day. Surfshark offers a proper graphical interface, which is a genuine quality-of-life improvement.

**What this means in practice:** A family of four with two phones each, a couple of laptops, a tablet, a smart TV, and a gaming console is looking at 12+ devices. With NordVPN, you're over the limit. With Surfshark, you're not even close to a problem. One $2.19/month subscription covers everything.

## The App Experience: Clean, But Not Flawless

Surfshark's apps are well-designed across platforms. Dark theme, sidebar server list, one-click connect -- it all works. The "Fastest Location" and "Nearest Country" quick-connect options are genuinely useful for anyone who doesn't want to think about server selection.

**What I like:** The mobile widgets on iOS and Android let you connect from your home screen without opening the app. The browser extensions include CleanWeb and a cookie pop-up blocker, making them useful even alongside the full VPN app. The desktop app sorts servers by country or speed and lets you favorite locations for quick access.

**What needs work:**
- Server load information is hidden by default -- you have to dig into settings to see it. I want to know if a server is at 85% capacity before I connect.
- The app sometimes takes 3-4 seconds to confirm a successful connection, which creates a moment of "wait, am I actually protected?" confusion.
- Auto-connect could be smarter. I want it to trigger only on untrusted Wi-Fi, not every time I open my laptop at home.

---

## Customer Support: Adequate, Not Outstanding

Surfshark offers 24/7 live chat and email support, plus a solid knowledge base with step-by-step setup guides for every platform.

**Live chat** connected me to an agent within 1-2 minutes during off-peak hours, with helpful answers. During peak hours (US/EU evenings), wait times stretched to 5-8 minutes, and initial responses felt scripted before the agent actually engaged with my question.

**Email support** averaged 3-6 hours for a response -- acceptable, but NordVPN typically replies in 1-2 hours. The quality of answers was good when they arrived.

Bottom line: support gets the job done, but it's not a strength. If fast, in-depth technical support is a priority for you, NordVPN and ExpressVPN both do it better.

## Common Mistakes People Make When Choosing a Budget VPN

After a decade in cybersecurity and testing dozens of VPN services, I see the same mistakes over and over. Avoid these:

1. **Choosing based on price alone without checking the jurisdiction.** Surfshark is based in the Netherlands -- EU, Nine Eyes alliance. That's not a dealbreaker (the RAM-only servers and no-logs audit address the concern), but plenty of people sign up without knowing this. If you're a journalist or activist in a high-risk country, consider a VPN based outside intelligence-sharing alliances, like Mullvad (Sweden is in 14 Eyes but Mullvad's architecture is uniquely private) or ProtonVPN (Switzerland).

2. **Ignoring the kill switch settings on Android.** I mentioned it above and I'll say it again: Surfshark's Android kill switch has known reliability issues. If you're on Android, go into settings, enable the kill switch manually, and run a leak test on [ipleak.net](https://ipleak.net/) to confirm it's working. Takes two minutes. Skipping this step defeats half the purpose of having a VPN.

3. **Paying monthly instead of committing to a longer plan.** Surfshark at $15.45/month is terrible value. At $2.19/month on the 2-year plan, it's one of the best deals in the industry. That's a 7x price difference for the same product. If you're not sure, use the 30-day money-back guarantee on a long-term plan instead of paying month-to-month while you "test."

4. **Expecting VPN to equal total anonymity.** A VPN encrypts your traffic and hides your IP. It does not make you invisible. If you're logged into Google and browsing with a VPN on, Google still knows exactly who you are. Pair your VPN with good browser hygiene, a private search engine, and consider compartmentalizing your online identities.

5. **Not testing streaming before the refund window closes.** Surfshark works with Netflix today. It might not work with a specific regional library next month -- streaming platforms and VPN providers play constant cat-and-mouse. Test every streaming service you care about within the first 30 days so you can get a refund if something critical doesn't work.

---

### Is Surfshark fast enough for gaming?

For gaming on servers within your continent, absolutely. I tested Fortnite and Valorant on Surfshark's Netherlands and UK servers and saw ping increases of only 3-10 ms -- barely noticeable. Even the New York server was playable at 82 ms ping. Where it falls apart is cross-continental gaming: a 268 ms ping to Sydney makes competitive gaming impossible. If you primarily game on regional servers and want the VPN for DDoS protection or accessing different game regions, Surfshark handles it well.

### Should I get Surfshark or NordVPN?

This is the question I get asked most. The honest answer: **NordVPN is the better VPN. Surfshark is the better deal.** NordVPN is faster on long-distance connections, has a more recent independent audit, better customer support, and a more reliable Android kill switch. Surfshark costs 37% less and gives you unlimited devices. If budget matters or you have a big household, Surfshark. If you want the best all-around VPN regardless of price, [NordVPN](/posts/nordvpn-review-2026/).

### Is Surfshark safe now that it's owned by Nord Security?

Yes. The 2022 merger raised legitimate concerns, but after three years of independent operation, the evidence is clear: Surfshark maintains its own server network, its own codebase, its own management team. The infrastructure has not been merged. If anything, being part of Nord Security gives Surfshark access to more resources for security R&D. The RAM-only architecture and Deloitte audit pre-date the merger, and both remain in place.

### Can I use Surfshark on my router to cover all devices?

Yes, and this is actually one of the smartest ways to use it. Install Surfshark on a compatible router (DD-WRT, Tomato, or OpenWrt firmware) and every device on your network is automatically protected -- including smart home devices, guest phones, and anything else that connects to your Wi-Fi. The downside: router-level VPN runs slower than app-level because consumer routers have limited processing power. On a modern router, expect 100-200 Mbps throughput depending on the encryption protocol.

## My Honest Verdict: Should You Get Surfshark in 2026?

<div class="rating">8.8/10</div>

After three months of daily use, Surfshark has earned its reputation as the best budget VPN on the market. The combination of $2.19/month pricing, unlimited device connections, and solid-enough performance makes it genuinely difficult to beat at this price point.

Here is what I keep coming back to: I can protect every device in my home lab, my family's phones, and a couple of travel laptops for about the price of a coffee per month. With NordVPN, I'd be juggling device slots. With ExpressVPN, I'd be paying three times as much.

**But I won't pretend it's perfect.** The distant server speeds fall behind NordVPN's NordLynx. The most recent independent audit is showing its age at three years old. The Android kill switch needs work. And if you're in a high-risk situation where VPN reliability could literally affect your safety, I'd point you toward Mullvad or ProtonVPN instead.

**My recommendation:** If you're on a budget, have a lot of devices, or just want a capable VPN that doesn't cost a fortune, Surfshark is an outstanding choice. I use it as my secondary VPN alongside NordVPN, and for most daily tasks -- streaming, public Wi-Fi protection, basic privacy -- it does everything I need.

If you have room in your budget and want the absolute best speeds, the most current audit trail, and faster support, go with <a href="https://go.nordvpn.net/aff_c?offer_id=612&aff_id=141337&url_id=14830" rel="nofollow sponsored" target="_blank">NordVPN</a> instead.
