## Surfshark Overview & Background

Surfshark launched in 2018 and quickly disrupted the VPN market with aggressive pricing and a feature set that rivaled services costing two or three times as much. The company made headlines in February 2022 when it merged with Nord Security, the parent company of NordVPN. This was a significant move that raised both excitement and concern among privacy advocates.

The merger means Surfshark and NordVPN now share the same parent company, but both brands insist they operate independently with separate infrastructure, separate development teams, and separate management. From our testing throughout 2025 and into 2026, the products do remain distinct -- Surfshark has its own server network, its own app design, and its own pricing model. That said, you may notice some convergence in features over time, which is not necessarily a bad thing given Nord Security's strong track record in cybersecurity.

Surfshark is headquartered in the Netherlands, which places it within EU jurisdiction. While the Netherlands does not have mandatory data retention laws for VPN providers specifically, it is part of the Nine Eyes intelligence-sharing alliance. Surfshark addresses this concern with a strict no-logs policy and RAM-only servers that cannot store persistent data. We will examine these privacy claims in detail in the security section below.

As of early 2026, Surfshark operates over 3,200 servers across 100 countries, making it one of the more geographically diverse VPN networks available.

---

## Pricing & Plans

Pricing is where Surfshark truly differentiates itself. It is consistently one of the most affordable premium VPNs on the market, and its 2026 pricing continues that tradition.

### Current Surfshark Plans (February 2026)

| Plan | Monthly Cost | Total Cost | Savings |
|------|-------------|------------|---------|
| 1 Month | $15.45/mo | $15.45 | -- |
| 1 Year | $2.99/mo | $35.88 | 81% off |
| 2 Years (+3 months free) | $2.19/mo | $59.13 | 86% off |

The two-year plan is the standout value. At just over $2 per month, you get a full-featured VPN with unlimited device connections. Compare that to NordVPN's equivalent plan at roughly $3.49/month or ExpressVPN at around $6.67/month, and the savings are substantial -- especially for families or anyone with a lot of devices.

Surfshark also offers two upgraded tiers:

- **Surfshark One** (starting at $2.69/mo on the two-year plan): Adds Surfshark Antivirus, Surfshark Alert (data breach monitoring), and Surfshark Search (a private search engine).
- **Surfshark One+** (starting at $3.99/mo on the two-year plan): Everything in Surfshark One plus Incogni, a personal data removal service that contacts data brokers on your behalf.

The Surfshark One+ bundle is genuinely compelling if you care about broader digital privacy. Incogni alone costs around $7/month as a standalone product, so bundling it with a VPN, antivirus, and breach alerts at under $4/month represents real value.

All plans come with a **30-day money-back guarantee**, which is industry standard and lets you test the service risk-free.

### Payment Methods

Surfshark accepts credit cards, PayPal, Google Pay, Amazon Pay, and cryptocurrency (via CoinGate). The cryptocurrency option is useful if you want to minimize the personal information tied to your account.

## Speed Test Results

We tested Surfshark's speeds from a baseline connection of 500 Mbps (fiber) in Western Europe. All tests were conducted using the WireGuard protocol, which is Surfshark's default and fastest option. We ran each test multiple times across different days and averaged the results.

### Speed Test Summary

| Server Location | Download Speed | Upload Speed | Ping | Speed Retention |
|-----------------|---------------|--------------|------|-----------------|
| **No VPN (baseline)** | 487 Mbps | 245 Mbps | 8 ms | -- |
| **Netherlands (nearest)** | 441 Mbps | 218 Mbps | 11 ms | 91% |
| **United Kingdom** | 412 Mbps | 195 Mbps | 18 ms | 85% |
| **United States (New York)** | 348 Mbps | 142 Mbps | 82 ms | 71% |
| **United States (Los Angeles)** | 291 Mbps | 118 Mbps | 138 ms | 60% |
| **Australia (Sydney)** | 187 Mbps | 72 Mbps | 268 ms | 38% |
| **Japan (Tokyo)** | 203 Mbps | 81 Mbps | 241 ms | 42% |

### Speed Analysis

On nearby servers, Surfshark's performance is excellent. The Netherlands and UK servers retained over 85% of our base speed, which is competitive with NordVPN and only marginally behind ExpressVPN's Lightway protocol results. For everyday browsing, streaming in 4K, video calls, and online gaming on European servers, these speeds are more than sufficient.

The transatlantic connection to New York performed well, retaining 71% of base speed. This is important because many users connect to US servers for streaming content. At 348 Mbps, you will have zero buffering issues on any streaming platform.

Where Surfshark shows its limitations is on long-distance connections. The Australia and Japan servers dropped to around 38-42% speed retention. While 187-203 Mbps is still perfectly usable, competitors like NordVPN with its NordLynx protocol managed to retain closer to 50-55% on similar routes in our [NordVPN review](/posts/nordvpn-review-2026/). If you frequently connect to servers on the other side of the world, this is worth noting.

Overall, Surfshark's speeds are more than adequate for the vast majority of users and use cases. The WireGuard implementation is well-optimized, and the performance gap with more expensive competitors has narrowed considerably since our last review.

## Security & Privacy Features

Security is where a VPN lives or dies, and Surfshark has invested heavily in building a robust feature set. Here is what you get.

### Encryption & Protocols

Surfshark supports the following VPN protocols:

- **WireGuard** -- The default and recommended protocol. It offers the best combination of speed and security with modern cryptographic primitives (ChaCha20, Curve25519, BLAKE2s).
- **OpenVPN (UDP/TCP)** -- The time-tested standard, useful in situations where WireGuard is blocked. AES-256-GCM encryption.
- **IKEv2/IPsec** -- Available on iOS and macOS, good for mobile connections that frequently switch between Wi-Fi and cellular.

We recommend sticking with WireGuard for most users. It is faster, uses fewer resources, and has a much smaller codebase (roughly 4,000 lines compared to OpenVPN's 600,000+), which makes it easier to audit.

### RAM-Only Servers

Surfshark's entire server network runs on RAM-only (diskless) infrastructure. This means that all server data is held in volatile memory and is wiped every time a server restarts. If a server were physically seized by authorities, it would contain no usable data. This is the same approach used by NordVPN and ExpressVPN, and it is considered best practice in the industry.

### No-Logs Policy

Surfshark maintains a strict no-logs policy, meaning they do not record your browsing activity, connection timestamps, IP addresses, bandwidth usage, or network traffic. This policy was verified by an independent audit conducted by Deloitte in 2023. While we would like to see a more recent audit -- ideally covering the full infrastructure rather than just the policy -- the existing audit and RAM-only architecture provide reasonable assurance.

### CleanWeb

CleanWeb is Surfshark's built-in ad and malware blocker. It operates at the DNS level to block ads, trackers, malware domains, and phishing attempts. In our testing, CleanWeb blocked approximately 78% of test ads and 91% of known malware domains. It is not a replacement for a dedicated antivirus solution, but it is a useful additional layer of protection, especially on mobile devices.

### MultiHop (Double VPN)

MultiHop routes your traffic through two VPN servers instead of one, adding an extra layer of encryption. Surfshark offers both preset MultiHop pairs and -- as of late 2025 -- the ability to create custom MultiHop connections by choosing your own entry and exit servers. This is a meaningful upgrade over the limited preset options available previously.

The trade-off is speed: MultiHop connections are noticeably slower (we measured roughly 40-50% additional speed loss). Use it when you need extra anonymity, not for everyday browsing.

### Camouflage Mode (Obfuscation)

Camouflage mode disguises your VPN traffic to look like regular HTTPS traffic. This is essential for users in countries that actively block VPN connections, such as China, Russia, Iran, and Turkey. In our testing, Camouflage mode successfully bypassed VPN detection on networks that blocked standard WireGuard and OpenVPN connections.

### NoBorders Mode

NoBorders mode automatically activates when Surfshark detects that you are on a restrictive network. It provides a curated list of servers that are optimized for working in censored environments. Combined with Camouflage mode, this makes Surfshark a viable option for users in countries with heavy internet censorship -- though we would still recommend more specialized tools for users facing serious personal risk.

### Kill Switch

The kill switch cuts your internet connection if the VPN drops unexpectedly, preventing your real IP address from leaking. Surfshark's kill switch worked reliably in our testing on Windows, macOS, and iOS. However, we encountered occasional issues on certain Android devices where the kill switch did not engage quickly enough during forced disconnections. Surfshark has acknowledged this and says improvements are in development.

### Additional Security Features

- **IP Rotator**: Periodically changes your assigned IP address without disconnecting from the VPN.
- **Nexus**: Surfshark's software-defined networking technology that connects you to a network of servers rather than a single server, improving performance and security.
- **Alternative ID**: Generates a new online persona with a proxy email address.
- **Bypasser (Split Tunneling)**: Lets you choose which apps and websites go through the VPN and which use your regular connection.

## Streaming & Torrenting

### Streaming Performance

One of the most common reasons people buy a VPN is to access geo-restricted streaming content. We tested Surfshark against all the major platforms.

| Streaming Service | US | UK | Canada | Australia | Japan |
|-------------------|----|----|--------|-----------|-------|
| Netflix | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Disney+ | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | -- |
| Amazon Prime Video | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | -- |
| BBC iPlayer | -- | Yes | -- | -- | -- |
| Hulu | Yes | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| HBO Max | Yes | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| DAZN | Yes | Yes | -- | -- | Yes |
| Peacock | Yes | -- | -- | -- | -- |

Surfshark successfully unblocked **Netflix in all five tested regions**, which is impressive. Many budget VPNs struggle with Netflix's increasingly aggressive VPN detection, but Surfshark's dedicated streaming-optimized servers handled it without issues. The connection was stable throughout multi-hour viewing sessions, with no mid-stream disconnections or quality drops.

**Disney+, Amazon Prime Video, BBC iPlayer, and Hulu** all worked reliably as well. BBC iPlayer, which is notoriously difficult to unblock, required connecting to Surfshark's London servers specifically -- the Manchester server did not work consistently.

For a deeper comparison of VPNs for streaming, check out our [best VPN for streaming in 2026](/posts/best-vpn-for-streaming-2026/) guide.

### Smart DNS

Surfshark includes Smart DNS, which allows you to unblock streaming content on devices that do not support VPN apps natively, such as smart TVs, gaming consoles, and older streaming devices. Smart DNS does not encrypt your traffic, but it redirects the DNS queries needed to bypass geo-restrictions. Setup requires manually entering Surfshark's DNS addresses into your device's network settings.

### Torrenting

Surfshark allows P2P traffic on all of its servers. When you connect to a server and begin torrenting, Surfshark automatically routes you through a P2P-optimized server if needed. In our testing, torrent speeds were good -- we downloaded a 10 GB Linux distribution ISO at an average of 28 MB/s on a nearby European server, which is solid performance.

The combination of the no-logs policy, kill switch, and RAM-only servers makes Surfshark a reasonable choice for torrenting. However, always ensure your kill switch is enabled before starting a torrent client, and be aware that legal torrenting is the only use case we support or recommend.

---

## Device Compatibility & Unlimited Connections

This is Surfshark's single biggest competitive advantage: **unlimited simultaneous device connections**. While NordVPN limits you to 10 devices and ExpressVPN to 8, Surfshark places no cap whatsoever. One subscription can cover your entire household -- every phone, laptop, tablet, smart TV, and router -- with room to spare.

### Supported Platforms

- **Desktop**: Windows, macOS, Linux (GUI app available)
- **Mobile**: iOS, Android
- **Browser Extensions**: Chrome, Firefox, Edge
- **Smart TVs**: Android TV, Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV (since tvOS 17+)
- **Gaming Consoles**: Via router or Smart DNS
- **Routers**: Compatible with most routers running DD-WRT, Tomato, or OpenWrt firmware

The Linux app deserves special mention. Unlike many VPN providers that offer only a command-line tool for Linux, Surfshark provides a full graphical user interface. This is a welcome feature for Linux users who do not want to manage VPN connections through the terminal.

### Real-World Multi-Device Performance

We tested Surfshark with 12 devices connected simultaneously -- three laptops, four phones, two tablets, a Fire TV Stick, a Chromecast, and a router. We experienced no noticeable degradation in performance compared to a single device. The VPN maintained stable connections on all devices throughout the testing period, and we did not encounter any automatic disconnections or authentication errors.

For families or anyone who lives in a shared household, this unlimited device policy translates into significant savings. Instead of buying separate VPN subscriptions or constantly juggling device slots, a single Surfshark plan covers everything.

## User Interface & Ease of Use

Surfshark's apps are clean, modern, and consistent across platforms. The design philosophy prioritizes simplicity without hiding advanced features -- you can connect with a single click, but power users can dig into protocol settings, split tunneling rules, and MultiHop configurations without difficulty.

### Desktop App (Windows & macOS)

The desktop app features a dark-themed interface with a sidebar listing server locations, a prominent connect/disconnect button, and easy access to settings. The server list can be sorted by country or by speed, and there is a search function for quickly finding specific locations. Favorited servers appear at the top for quick access.

One thoughtful design choice is the "Fastest Location" and "Nearest Country" quick-connect options. These automatically select the best server based on latency and load, which is ideal for users who do not want to think about server selection.

### Mobile App (iOS & Android)

The mobile apps mirror the desktop experience in a touch-friendly format. We appreciated the widget support on both iOS and Android, which lets you connect to the VPN directly from your home screen without opening the app. The Android app includes the Bypasser (split tunneling) feature, though this is not available on iOS due to Apple's platform restrictions.

### Browser Extensions

Surfshark's browser extensions for Chrome, Firefox, and Edge function as lightweight VPN proxies. They encrypt your browser traffic but do not cover other apps on your device. The extensions include CleanWeb and a cookie pop-up blocker, making them useful even alongside the full VPN app.

### Areas for Improvement

- The server load information is not displayed by default -- you need to navigate to the settings to enable it.
- The app occasionally takes a few seconds to reflect a successful connection, which can create momentary confusion about whether you are actually protected.
- Auto-connect settings could be more granular (for example, auto-connecting only on untrusted Wi-Fi networks).

---

## Customer Support

Surfshark offers 24/7 live chat support and email support. There is also a comprehensive knowledge base with setup guides, troubleshooting articles, and FAQs.

### Live Chat

We tested live chat support at various times across different days. During off-peak hours, we were connected to an agent within 1-2 minutes and received helpful, knowledgeable responses. During peak hours (evening in US and European time zones), wait times stretched to 5-8 minutes, and the initial responses occasionally felt scripted before the agent engaged more substantively with our questions.

### Email Support

Email responses arrived within 3-6 hours in our testing, which is acceptable but slower than NordVPN's typical 1-2 hour turnaround. The quality of email responses was generally good, with clear instructions and relevant links.

### Knowledge Base

The online knowledge base is well-organized and covers installation, troubleshooting, billing, and general VPN education. Setup guides include step-by-step instructions with screenshots for every supported platform.

Overall, customer support is adequate but not exceptional. If you need immediate, in-depth technical support, NordVPN and ExpressVPN both offer a slightly better experience. For most questions, though, Surfshark's support will get the job done.

## Surfshark vs. Competitors

How does Surfshark stack up against the other top VPNs in 2026? Here is a quick comparison.

| Feature | Surfshark | NordVPN | ExpressVPN |
|---------|-----------|---------|------------|
| **Monthly Price (2yr plan)** | $2.19/mo | $3.49/mo | $6.67/mo |
| **Simultaneous Connections** | Unlimited | 10 | 8 |
| **Server Count** | 3,200+ | 6,400+ | 3,000+ |
| **Countries** | 100 | 111 | 105 |
| **Default Protocol** | WireGuard | NordLynx (WireGuard) | Lightway |
| **Speed (US East Coast)** | 348 Mbps | 392 Mbps | 405 Mbps |
| **RAM-Only Servers** | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Ad Blocker** | CleanWeb | Threat Protection | No |
| **Independent Audit** | Deloitte (2023) | Deloitte (2024) | KPMG (2024) |
| **Kill Switch Reliability** | Good | Excellent | Excellent |
| **Overall Rating** | 8.8/10 | 9.2/10 | 9.0/10 |

### Surfshark vs. NordVPN

NordVPN edges ahead in raw speed, server count, and the frequency of its security audits. Its Threat Protection feature is also more comprehensive than CleanWeb. However, Surfshark costs roughly 37% less and offers unlimited device connections versus NordVPN's limit of 10. If budget and device flexibility are your priorities, Surfshark wins. If you want the fastest speeds and the most thoroughly audited security, NordVPN is the better pick.

For a full breakdown, see our [NordVPN review for 2026](/posts/nordvpn-review-2026/).

### Surfshark vs. ExpressVPN

ExpressVPN offers marginally faster speeds and a slightly more polished user experience, but it costs roughly three times as much as Surfshark on a two-year plan. It also limits you to 8 simultaneous connections. For most users, the performance difference does not justify the price premium. ExpressVPN's main advantage is its Lightway protocol, which is proprietary and has been independently audited, and its robust track record in high-censorship countries.

## Who Should Choose Surfshark?

Surfshark is the ideal VPN for:

- **Budget-conscious users** who want premium features at a fraction of the price
- **Families and households** with many devices (unlimited connections is a genuine differentiator)
- **Streaming enthusiasts** who need reliable access to geo-restricted content
- **Students** and anyone on a tight budget who does not want to sacrifice security
- **Users who want a simple, no-fuss VPN** that works well out of the box

Surfshark may not be the best fit if:

- You need the absolute fastest speeds on long-distance connections
- You require the most rigorously and recently audited VPN infrastructure
- You live in a high-risk environment where VPN reliability is a safety concern (consider Mullvad or ProtonVPN for such scenarios)

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is Surfshark safe to use in 2026?

Yes. Surfshark uses industry-standard encryption (AES-256 for OpenVPN, ChaCha20 for WireGuard), operates RAM-only servers, and maintains a verified no-logs policy. The merger with Nord Security has not compromised its security -- if anything, it has given Surfshark access to additional resources for security development. That said, no VPN is a guarantee of absolute anonymity, and you should combine a VPN with good digital hygiene practices.

### Does Surfshark work with Netflix?

Yes. In our 2026 testing, Surfshark successfully unblocked Netflix in the US, UK, Canada, Australia, and Japan. It also works with Disney+, Amazon Prime Video, BBC iPlayer, Hulu, HBO Max, and most other major streaming platforms. For the best results, connect to the server closest to the content region you want to access.

### How many devices can I use with Surfshark?

Surfshark allows **unlimited simultaneous connections** on a single subscription. This means you can protect every device in your household -- phones, laptops, tablets, smart TVs, routers, and more -- without any device limits. This is one of Surfshark's most significant advantages over competitors like NordVPN (10 devices) and ExpressVPN (8 devices).

### Is Surfshark owned by NordVPN?

Surfshark and NordVPN are both owned by the same parent company, Nord Security, following a merger completed in 2022. However, both brands continue to operate as independent products with separate server infrastructure, separate development teams, and separate management. They are sibling companies, not the same product.

### Does Surfshark work in China?

Surfshark's Camouflage mode and NoBorders mode are designed to bypass internet censorship. Reports from users in China indicate that Surfshark works intermittently -- it is not as consistently reliable as some specialized services, but it does work on certain servers. If you are traveling to China, download and configure Surfshark before you arrive, and identify working servers in advance.

### Can I use Surfshark for torrenting?

Yes. Surfshark allows P2P traffic on its servers and will automatically route you through optimized P2P servers when it detects torrent traffic. The no-logs policy and kill switch provide reasonable privacy protection for torrenting. Always enable the kill switch before opening your torrent client.

### Does Surfshark offer a free trial?

Surfshark does not offer a traditional free trial, but all plans include a **30-day money-back guarantee**. You can sign up, use the service fully for up to 30 days, and request a full refund if you are not satisfied. On Android and iOS, a 7-day free trial is sometimes available through the app stores, though availability varies by region.

### Is Surfshark good for password management?

Surfshark is a VPN and does not include a dedicated password manager. If you are looking for a reliable password manager to complement your VPN, we recommend considering <a href="https://go.nordpass.io/aff_c?offer_id=488&aff_id=141337&url_id=9356" rel="nofollow sponsored" target="_blank">NordPass</a>, which is also part of the Nord Security family and integrates well with an overall security setup. You can also check out our [best password managers for 2026](/posts/best-password-managers-2026/) guide for more options.

## Final Verdict

<div class="rating">⭐⭐⭐⭐ 8.8/10</div>

Surfshark remains the best budget VPN on the market in 2026. Its combination of low pricing, unlimited device connections, solid speed performance, and a comprehensive feature set makes it extremely difficult to beat at its price point. The fact that you can protect an entire household for roughly $2 per month is remarkable.

It is not perfect. Speeds on distant servers lag behind NordVPN and ExpressVPN, the most recent independent audit is now a few years old, and customer support could be faster during peak hours. These are legitimate weaknesses that prevent it from claiming the overall top spot in our rankings.

But here is the thing: for the vast majority of users, those weaknesses will never matter in practice. If you want a VPN that unblocks streaming platforms, keeps your browsing private, works on all your devices, and does not strain your wallet, Surfshark delivers on every count.

**Our recommendation:** If you are on a budget or need to cover many devices, Surfshark is an outstanding choice. If you have more room in your budget and prioritize speed and audit transparency above all else, consider NordVPN instead. Either way, you are getting a capable, trustworthy VPN.
