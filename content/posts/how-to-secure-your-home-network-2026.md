Your home network connects everything — laptops, phones, smart TVs, security cameras, baby monitors, thermostats, and more. If a hacker gets into your network, they get access to all of it.

The good news: securing your home network doesn't require a degree in cybersecurity. Follow these steps and you'll be better protected than 95% of households.

## Step 1: Secure Your Router

Your router is the front door of your home network. Most people never change the default settings — which is exactly what attackers count on.

### Change the Default Admin Password
Every router ships with a default admin password (usually "admin/admin" or "admin/password"). Change it immediately.

1. Open your browser and go to `192.168.1.1` or `192.168.0.1`
2. Log in with the default credentials (check the sticker on your router)
3. Go to **Administration** or **System Settings**
4. Change the admin password to something strong and unique

### Update the Firmware
Router manufacturers regularly patch security vulnerabilities. Most people never update.

1. Check your router's admin panel for a "Firmware Update" option
2. Enable **automatic updates** if available
3. If your router is more than 5 years old, consider replacing it — older routers stop receiving security patches

### Change the Default WiFi Name (SSID)
Your default SSID often reveals the router brand and model, making it easier for attackers to find known vulnerabilities.

- Change it to something that doesn't identify you or your router brand
- **Don't use:** your name, address, or apartment number
- **Good examples:** "PrettyFlyForAWiFi" or "NetworkNotFound"

## Step 2: Use Strong WiFi Encryption

### Use WPA3 (or WPA2 at Minimum)

| Protocol | Security | Use It? |
|----------|----------|---------|
| **WPA3** | Excellent | ✅ Yes — if your devices support it |
| **WPA2** | Good | ✅ Yes — still secure with a strong password |
| **WPA** | Weak | ❌ No — crackable in minutes |
| **WEP** | Broken | ❌ Never — crackable in seconds |

Check your router settings and make sure you're using **WPA3** or **WPA2-AES**. If your router only supports WPA or WEP, it's time for a new router.

### Set a Strong WiFi Password
- Minimum 16 characters
- Mix of letters, numbers, and symbols
- Don't use dictionary words or personal information
- Use your password manager to generate and store it

## Step 3: Create a Guest Network

Most modern routers support a separate guest network. Use it for:
- **Visitors** — Give them WiFi access without exposing your main network
- **IoT devices** — Smart TVs, cameras, thermostats, and smart speakers
- **Kids' devices** — Isolate their gaming consoles and tablets

Why? If a smart lightbulb gets hacked (yes, this happens), the attacker can't pivot to your laptop with your banking info.

### How to Set It Up
1. Go to your router's admin panel
2. Find **Guest Network** settings
3. Enable it with a different SSID and password
4. Enable **client isolation** (prevents devices on the guest network from seeing each other)

## Step 4: Use a VPN on Your Router

A VPN on your router encrypts all traffic from every device on your network — even devices that don't support VPN apps (smart TVs, IoT devices).

### Best VPNs with Router Support

| VPN | Router Support | Setup Difficulty |
|-----|---------------|-----------------|
| **NordVPN** | Excellent — custom firmware | Medium |
| **Surfshark** | Good — manual setup | Medium |
| **ExpressVPN** | Best — Aircove router | Easy |

## Step 5: Enable Your Firewall

Your router has a built-in firewall — make sure it's turned on.

1. Go to your router admin panel
2. Find **Firewall** or **Security** settings
3. Enable **SPI Firewall** (Stateful Packet Inspection)
4. Disable **WPS** (WiFi Protected Setup) — it's a known security weakness
5. Disable **UPnP** unless you specifically need it — it can expose internal services

## Step 6: Monitor Your Network

### Know What's Connected
Regularly check your router's admin panel for the list of connected devices. If you see something you don't recognize:
1. Check the MAC address against your known devices
2. If unknown, block it and change your WiFi password
3. Consider using a network scanner like Fing (free app)

### Set Up Alerts
Some routers and security tools can alert you when a new device connects. Enable this feature if available.

## Step 7: Protect Individual Devices

A secure network isn't enough — each device needs protection too.

| Device | Protection Needed |
|--------|------------------|
| Computers | Antivirus + firewall + updates |
| Phones | Updates + app permissions review |
| Smart TV | Guest network + disable tracking |
| Security cameras | Strong password + firmware updates |
| Smart speakers | Review privacy settings + guest network |

### Recommended Security Software

For comprehensive device protection, we recommend:

- **Bitdefender Total Security** — covers up to 5 devices, includes network scanner
- **Norton 360** — includes VPN and dark web monitoring
- **ESET Smart Security** — has a built-in Network Inspector

## The Complete Home Network Security Checklist

- [ ] Change router admin password
- [ ] Update router firmware
- [ ] Change default SSID
- [ ] Use WPA3 or WPA2-AES encryption
- [ ] Set a strong WiFi password (16+ characters)
- [ ] Create a guest network for IoT and visitors
- [ ] Enable SPI firewall
- [ ] Disable WPS and UPnP
- [ ] Install antivirus on all computers
- [ ] Keep all devices updated
- [ ] Consider a router VPN
- [ ] Review connected devices monthly

## When to Replace Your Router

Replace your router if:
- It's more than 5 years old
- It doesn't support WPA3 (or at least WPA2)
- It no longer receives firmware updates
- It doesn't support guest networks
- You've outgrown its WiFi range or speed

A modern WiFi 6E or WiFi 7 router costs $100-200 and will last 5+ years. It's a worthwhile security investment.
