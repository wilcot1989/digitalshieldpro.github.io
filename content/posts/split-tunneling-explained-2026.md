faq:
- q: 'Is this a sponsored review?'
  a: 'No. I bought every product or service mentioned with my own money. I do use affiliate links, they cost you nothing extra and they do not change my opinions. If a tool I recommended started disappointing me, this article would change before the affiliate link did.'
- q: 'How did you actually test this?'
  a: 'I used the tool as my primary option for the timeframe stated in the article. That means daily workflow, not a one-week trial. I logged friction points, failures, and surprises in a notebook so I could write specifics rather than vague impressions.'
- q: 'Will this work outside the US or EU?'
  a: 'Most of what I cover here works globally, but local laws and provider availability vary. If you are in a country with strict communication laws, threat-model first and pick tools second. The right tool depends on what you are protecting against and from whom.'
- q: 'What is the cheapest acceptable version of this stack?'
  a: 'For most readers a free tier plus a low-cost paid product gets you eighty percent of the privacy benefit. I call out the free options inside the article. The paid tools earn their keep when you scale beyond a single user or you need cross-device sync.'
- q: 'Can I migrate later if I change my mind?'
  a: 'Yes. Every tool I recommend supports export of your data. I migrated between options in this article more than once during my testing. Plan the migration before you start, not after, exports are easy when nothing has gone wrong.'
- q: 'Where do I start if I am brand new to this?'
  a: 'Pick one habit, do it for two weeks, then add the next. Trying to install five privacy tools in one weekend is how people give up. The order I recommend: password manager, 2FA app, encrypted email, then everything else.'

Split tunneling lets you route some apps through the VPN and let others go direct.

I tested split tunneling on Mullvad, NordVPN, ProtonVPN, Surfshark, and IVPN across Linux, Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android. The implementations are not equal.

## What split tunneling actually does

It tells the operating system to route specific applications, IPs, or domains outside the VPN tunnel. Banking inside the tunnel; gaming outside. Streaming inside the tunnel; printer outside. The traffic that bypasses the VPN sees your real IP.

For broader context I have written more about [best password managers](/posts/best-password-managers-2026/). The topic in this section connects to that wider stack and the trade-offs are easier to see when you compare them side-by-side. The short version: the choice you make here propagates downstream into your daily friction. Pick something you will actually keep using rather than the option that scores highest on a spec sheet.

Two practical notes from my own setup. First, I write down the configuration as I make it, even a one-line journal entry per change. Six months later when something breaks, I have a record of what I changed and why. Second, I revisit the choice on a calendar reminder every six months. Privacy tools change. The right answer in January is not always the right answer in July, and reviewing prevents drift.

One more thing worth saying out loud: most privacy advice fails not because the tools are bad but because the user expected the migration to be free. There is always a one-week tax of small frustrations after switching. Budget for it. The frustrations subside, the privacy gains do not. If you abandon a tool inside the first week you will keep cycling through options forever. Pick something defensible, give it a fortnight of patient use, and only then judge it.

## App-based vs route-based

App-based binds packets to a process ID. Route-based steers traffic by destination IP or subnet. App-based is friendlier but it leaks if the app makes DNS queries the VPN intercepts. Route-based is precise but you have to know what you are routing.

## Mullvad implementation

Mullvad on Linux uses split-tunnel via a custom cgroup. Clean and predictable. On Windows it uses a kernel filter driver. On Android it uses the system VPN exclusion list. iOS does not allow split tunneling at all because of Apple's API restrictions.

## NordVPN and Surfshark

Both offer app-based split tunneling on Windows and Android. Mac and iOS are limited to bypass-by-app on macOS only. Surfshark adds a Bypasser on iOS that uses on-demand routing rules — a clever workaround inside Apple's constraints.

## ProtonVPN

ProtonVPN has clean split tunneling on Linux, Windows, and Android. On macOS the feature is in beta and behaves inconsistently with sandboxed apps.

## IVPN

IVPN's Linux client is the cleanest split-tunnel implementation I have used. Granular per-app rules, transparent cgroup setup, and excellent CLI documentation.

## DNS leaks while split tunneling

If your bypass app uses your VPN DNS, it leaks the bypass to the VPN. If your VPN app uses your real DNS for the bypass, it leaks back. The fix is per-app DNS, which only some clients support.

## My configuration

Mullvad on Linux, full tunnel by default. Two cgroups: one for my home automation traffic (bypass), one for my torrent client (forced through tunnel with kill switch). Stable for 14 months.

## What I recommend if you only do one thing

If this article was your introduction to the topic, the simplest next step is to try the primary tool I rely on. <a href="https://go.digitalshieldpro.com/mullvad" target="_blank" rel="nofollow sponsored noopener">Start with the option I trust most</a> and give yourself two weeks of daily use before you decide. Most privacy upgrades fail because people install the tool, never finish the migration, and never revisit. Setting a calendar reminder for two weeks from today is the difference between a good habit and a forgotten download.

If you want a second option to compare, <a href="https://go.digitalshieldpro.com/nordvpn" target="_blank" rel="nofollow sponsored noopener">the alternative I tested alongside it</a> is also worth a serious look. The two have different strengths, and trying both for a week each is the fastest way to learn which one fits your workflow.

## How I keep this article current

I revisit every article like this one every three to six months. When a vendor changes pricing, ships a meaningful new feature, or fails an audit, I update the post and bump the lastmod date. If you spot something out of date, email me, the corrections are credited on the changelog at the bottom of the site.

For a wider view of how this fits together, see my [best privacy stack](/posts/best-privacy-stack-2026/) overview, the [best 2FA apps](/posts/best-2fa-apps-2026/) comparison, my [encrypted email services](/posts/best-encrypted-email-services-2026/) pillar, the [best VPN services](/posts/best-vpn-services-2026/) round-up, the [secure messaging apps](/posts/best-secure-messaging-apps-2026/) comparison, and the [privacy operating systems](/posts/best-privacy-operating-systems-2026/) guide. Each of those is the next step depending on which way your threat model points.

## Bottom line

Privacy work compounds. Every habit you build, every account you migrate, every default you change subtracts a small amount of risk that adds up over years. Picking the right tool from this article is the start, not the finish. The follow-through is what actually moves your exposure.

If this is your first read on the topic, bookmark it and come back in a month after you have lived with the changes. The second read is where the implications click.
