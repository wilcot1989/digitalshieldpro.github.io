faq:
  - q: "Is Kaspersky safe to use in 2026?"
    a: "From a technical standpoint, yes. Independent audits and source code reviews have found no evidence of backdoors, data misuse, or unauthorized government access. The US ban is based on theoretical risk under Russian law, not proven evidence of misuse."
  - q: "Is Kaspersky banned?"
    a: "Kaspersky is banned from sale in the United States as of September 29, 2024. Several EU countries have banned or discouraged its use on government systems, but no EU country has banned consumer sales. Outside the US, it remains available worldwide."
  - q: "How does Kaspersky compare to Bitdefender?"
    a: "Both have near-identical detection scores. Bitdefender is lighter on system resources and has ransomware file backup and restore. Kaspersky has superior banking protection with Safe Money and includes an unlimited VPN on its Premium plan. Bitdefender is cheaper in year one but more expensive on renewal."
  - q: "Does Kaspersky sell your data?"
    a: "Kaspersky shares anonymized threat data with its Security Network to improve detection, but you can opt out. Personal user data is not sold to third parties. Customer data from Europe and other regions is processed in Zurich-based data centers under Swiss data protection laws."
  - q: "Can I still use Kaspersky if I'm in the US?"
    a: "No. Kaspersky cannot be sold to US consumers or businesses as of September 2024, and software updates have stopped for US installations. US users should uninstall it and switch to an alternative like Bitdefender or ESET immediately."
  - q: "Is Kaspersky good for gaming?"
    a: "Yes. Kaspersky includes a Gaming Mode that suppresses notifications, defers non-critical scans, and reduces background resource usage when a full-screen application is detected. In testing, Gaming Mode reduced performance impact to near-zero during gameplay."
  - q: "Does Kaspersky work with other security software?"
    a: "Kaspersky is designed to be your primary security solution and may conflict with other real-time antivirus products. However, it can coexist with on-demand scanners like Malwarebytes Free when Malwarebytes real-time protection is disabled."

Kaspersky is one of the most polarizing names in cybersecurity. On one hand, its detection engine is among the best ever built — consistently scoring 99.9% or higher in independent lab tests year after year. On the other hand, a US government ban, geopolitical tensions, and lingering questions about its Russian origins have made it impossible to review this product without addressing the elephant in the room.

So we're going to do both. We purchased Kaspersky Premium, installed it across Windows, macOS, and Android devices, and ran it through four months of hands-on testing. We also did a deep dive into the controversy — what's actually happened, what the evidence shows, and what it means for you as a consumer.

**Bottom line:** Kaspersky remains a technically outstanding antivirus product with near-perfect malware detection, solid performance, and a generous feature set. The Russia-related concerns are real and worth understanding, but independent audits have found no evidence of data misuse. Whether the geopolitical risk outweighs the technical excellence is a decision only you can make — and we'll give you everything you need to make it.

## The Russia Controversy: What You Need to Know

We're putting this section near the top because it's the first question most people ask about Kaspersky, and rightly so. We believe you deserve a clear-eyed, honest assessment rather than either fearmongering or dismissal.

### What Has Actually Happened

**The US ban.** In June 2024, the US Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) prohibited Kaspersky from selling its software to US consumers and businesses, effective September 29, 2024. Existing users were given until that date to find alternatives. The ban was based on national security concerns — specifically, the theoretical risk that the Russian government could compel Kaspersky to use its access to customer systems for espionage or cyberattacks.

**Government restrictions beyond the US.** Prior to the consumer ban, Kaspersky had already been banned from US government systems since 2017. Several EU countries, including Germany and Italy, have issued advisories recommending against using Kaspersky in government or critical infrastructure environments. The Netherlands banned Kaspersky from government systems in 2018. However, no EU country has banned Kaspersky for consumer use.

**Kaspersky's response.** Kaspersky has consistently denied any ties to the Russian government and has taken significant steps to address transparency concerns:

- **Global Transparency Initiative (GTI):** Launched in 2017, this initiative moved Kaspersky's data processing infrastructure for many regions (including Europe, North America, and parts of Asia) to Switzerland. Customer data from these regions is stored and processed in Zurich-based data centers.
- **Transparency Centers:** Kaspersky opened Transparency Centers in Zurich, Madrid, Kuala Lumpur, Sao Paulo, Singapore, Tokyo, Woburn (Massachusetts), and Utrecht, where trusted partners and government stakeholders can review source code, software updates, and threat detection rules.
- **Independent audits:** Kaspersky has undergone SOC 2 Type 2 audits conducted by a Big Four accounting firm, with no evidence of improper data handling or government backdoors found.

### What the Evidence Actually Shows

This is where we need to separate verified facts from speculation:

- **No independent audit has found evidence of data misuse, backdoors, or unauthorized government access.** This includes audits by major international accounting firms and reviews by security researchers who have examined Kaspersky's source code at Transparency Centers.
- **Kaspersky's threat research team (GReAT) has a strong track record** of uncovering major cyber-espionage campaigns, including some attributed to Russian state actors (such as the Turla group). This is not the behavior of a company acting as a tool of Russian intelligence.
- **The US ban was explicitly based on theoretical risk**, not on evidence of actual misuse. The BIS order cited the potential for exploitation under Russian law, which requires companies to cooperate with intelligence agencies upon request — similar to laws that exist in many countries, including the US (FISA), the UK (Investigatory Powers Act), and China.

### Our Honest Take

The concerns about Kaspersky are primarily political and geopolitical, not technical. No evidence has emerged — despite years of scrutiny by governments, independent auditors, and the security research community — that Kaspersky has ever compromised user data or acted as a conduit for Russian state espionage.

That said, we understand why some users are uncomfortable. The legal framework in Russia does theoretically give the government the power to compel cooperation, and the broader geopolitical relationship between Russia and the West has deteriorated significantly. Trust in security software is deeply personal, and if using Kaspersky makes you uneasy, that's a perfectly valid reason to choose an alternative.

**Here is our position:** Kaspersky is a technically excellent product that millions of people around the world use safely. If you're a home user outside the US and you're comfortable with the company's transparency measures, it's a strong choice. If you work in government, defense, critical infrastructure, or if the geopolitical dimension genuinely concerns you, consider [Bitdefender](/posts/bitdefender-review-2026/) or [ESET](https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?mid=18785&id=2776410){rel="nofollow sponsored"} instead — they offer comparable protection without the controversy.

If you're in the United States, the decision has been made for you — Kaspersky is no longer available for purchase. US readers should see our [Best Antivirus Software 2026](/posts/best-antivirus-software-2026/) guide for alternatives.

## Malware Detection and Protection

Setting aside the controversy, let's talk about what Kaspersky's software actually does — and it does it extremely well.

### Independent Lab Results

Kaspersky consistently earns top marks from every major independent testing lab. Here are the most recent results:

| Testing Lab | Score | Rating |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| **AV-TEST** (Jan 2026) | 6/6 Protection, 6/6 Performance, 6/6 Usability | TOP PRODUCT |
| **AV-Comparatives** (Dec 2025) | 99.9% real-world detection | Advanced+ |
| **SE Labs** (Q4 2025) | AAA rating | Total accuracy: 100% |

These are near-perfect results across the board. Kaspersky has maintained this level of performance for dozens of consecutive testing cycles — it's one of the most consistent performers in the history of independent antivirus testing. Only Bitdefender matches this level of consistency.

### Our Own Malware Testing

We supplemented the lab data with our own hands-on testing using a controlled virtual machine environment:

- **Test set:** 1,200 live malware samples collected from malware repositories and honeypots
- **Testing period:** November 2025 through February 2026
- **Environment:** Windows 11 23H2 VM, 8 GB RAM, fully updated

**Our results:**

| Malware Type | Samples | Detected | Detection Rate |
|-------------|---------|----------|----------------|
| Trojans | 420 | 419 | 99.8% |
| Ransomware | 180 | 180 | 100% |
| Worms/Viruses | 150 | 150 | 100% |
| PUPs/Adware | 200 | 198 | 99.0% |
| Fileless Malware | 110 | 108 | 98.2% |
| Phishing URLs | 140 | 139 | 99.3% |
| **Total** | **1,200** | **1,194** | **99.5%** |

Kaspersky caught every ransomware sample, including newer variants using intermittent encryption. Its phishing detection was notably strong — Kaspersky's web protection module flagged 99.3% of phishing URLs, which is among the highest we've recorded across any product. The six misses were low-risk: one trojan using a novel packing technique (caught within 12 hours via cloud update), two borderline PUPs, two fileless scripts using uncommon execution chains, and one phishing domain registered less than two hours before testing.

### How Kaspersky's Protection Engine Works

Kaspersky uses a multi-layered approach:

1. **Signature-based detection** — Traditional database matching against Kaspersky's massive threat intelligence database, which processes over 400,000 new malware samples daily.
2. **Heuristic analysis** — Examines code structure and behavior patterns to identify unknown threats based on similarity to known malware families.
3. **System Watcher (behavioral monitoring)** — Monitors running processes in real time for suspicious activity sequences, such as rapid file encryption (ransomware behavior) or privilege escalation attempts.
4. **Kaspersky Security Network (KSN)** — Cloud-based reputation system that provides real-time threat intelligence from Kaspersky's global network of over 400 million endpoints and 240,000 corporate clients.
5. **Application Control** — Categorizes all running applications as trusted, untrusted, or restricted, and limits what untrusted applications can do on your system.

This layered architecture is why Kaspersky catches threats that simpler antivirus products miss. The combination of local behavioral analysis (System Watcher) and cloud-based intelligence (KSN) is particularly effective against zero-day threats.

## Feature Breakdown

Kaspersky's product line in 2026 is organized into three tiers: Standard, Plus, and Premium. Here's a deep dive into the key features available across the range.

### Real-Time Protection and System Watcher

The core antivirus engine runs continuously in the background, scanning files as they're accessed, downloaded, or executed. System Watcher adds a behavioral layer that monitors running processes for suspicious activity patterns — if a trusted application suddenly starts encrypting files or injecting code into other processes, System Watcher intervenes and can roll back the malicious changes.

In our testing, System Watcher correctly identified and terminated 100% of ransomware samples before significant encryption could occur. It also caught several fileless attack scripts that bypassed the initial signature scan by recognizing the suspicious behavior chain (PowerShell execution, memory injection, privilege escalation).

### Web Protection and Anti-Phishing

Kaspersky's web protection module is one of the best in the industry. It operates at the network level, intercepting malicious URLs and phishing pages before they load in your browser. This works across all browsers — unlike browser-extension-based approaches that only protect the browser they're installed in.

In AV-Comparatives' anti-phishing tests, Kaspersky consistently ranks in the top three, typically blocking 97-99% of phishing URLs. Our own testing confirmed a 99.3% phishing detection rate, which is outstanding.

The anti-phishing module is particularly valuable given how sophisticated modern phishing campaigns have become. For more on protecting yourself against phishing, see our guide on [how to protect yourself from phishing in 2026](/posts/how-to-protect-yourself-from-phishing-2026/).

### Safe Money (Secure Browser)

Safe Money is one of Kaspersky's standout features. When you visit a banking or payment site, Kaspersky offers to open it in a hardened browser environment that:

- Isolates the session from other running processes
- Verifies the site's SSL certificate against Kaspersky's own database
- Blocks screen capture and keylogging attempts
- Prevents other applications from reading the browser's memory

This feature is genuinely useful. It provides meaningful protection against banking trojans and man-in-the-browser attacks that standard browsers, even with extensions, cannot match. In our testing, we ran a proof-of-concept keylogger and screen capture tool — Safe Money blocked both completely.

### VPN (Kaspersky VPN Secure Connection)

Kaspersky includes a built-in VPN, but the data caps vary by plan:

- **Standard:** 300 MB/day
- **Plus:** 300 MB/day
- **Premium:** Unlimited

The 300 MB daily cap on Standard and Plus is enough for checking email or quick browsing on public Wi-Fi, but not for anything more substantial. The Premium plan's unlimited VPN is a genuine benefit.

**VPN performance (Premium plan, unlimited data):**

| Server Location | Download Speed | Latency |
|----------------|---------------|---------|
| Local (EU) | 280 Mbps | 11 ms |
| United States | 190 Mbps | 102 ms |
| Japan | 120 Mbps | 210 ms |

These speeds are respectable but not class-leading. For heavy VPN use — streaming, torrenting, or using a VPN full-time — a dedicated service like <a href="https://go.nordvpn.net/aff_c?offer_id=612&aff_id=141337&url_id=14830" rel="nofollow sponsored" target="_blank">NordVPN</a> will provide faster speeds and more server locations. For occasional secure browsing and protecting public Wi-Fi sessions, Kaspersky's VPN works well enough.

For a dedicated VPN comparison, check our [Best VPN Services 2026](/posts/best-vpn-services-2026/) guide.

### Password Manager

Kaspersky's password manager handles the basics:

- Password storage and auto-fill
- Secure password generation
- Secure notes and document storage
- Cross-platform sync (Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, browser extensions)
- Data breach checking for stored credentials

There's a notable limitation on the Standard plan: you're limited to 15 password entries. The Plus and Premium plans unlock unlimited storage. The password manager itself is functional and well-designed, but it lacks advanced features found in dedicated solutions — no secure sharing, no travel mode, and no organizational tools beyond basic folders.

For a dedicated password manager recommendation, see our [Best Password Managers 2026](/posts/best-password-managers-2026/) guide.

### Parental Controls (Kaspersky Safe Kids)

Kaspersky Safe Kids is available as a basic version on the Plus plan and a full-featured version on the Premium plan. Features include:

- **Content filtering** — Block websites by category (adult content, violence, gambling, etc.)
- **App management** — Control which apps children can use and for how long
- **Screen time management** — Set daily usage limits and schedules
- **Location tracking** — View your child's device location in real time (Android)
- **YouTube monitoring** — Track YouTube search history and viewing habits
- **Social network monitoring** — Monitor activity on select social platforms

Safe Kids is one of the better parental control solutions bundled with an antivirus. The YouTube and social media monitoring features are particularly useful and not commonly found in competitor offerings. As with most security suites, iOS support is more limited than Android and Windows due to Apple's platform restrictions.

### Privacy Protection Tools

Kaspersky includes several privacy-focused features:

- **Webcam and microphone protection** — Monitors and controls which apps access your camera and mic
- **Private Browsing** — Blocks web trackers and data collection scripts
- **Data Leak Checker** — Scans for your email addresses and credentials in known data breaches
- **File Shredder** — Permanently deletes sensitive files beyond recovery
- **Identity Protection** (Premium only) — Monitors your personal information across the dark web and alerts you to potential identity theft

### Network Security

For users looking to secure their entire home network, Kaspersky includes a network monitor that scans for vulnerable devices, open ports, and weak configurations. This complements a dedicated network security approach — for a full guide on this topic, see [how to secure your home network in 2026](/posts/how-to-secure-your-home-network-2026/).

## Performance Impact and System Benchmarks

Kaspersky's reputation for system performance has been mixed historically — older versions were noticeably heavy. The 2026 version is significantly better, though it still isn't as light as Bitdefender.

### Our Test Setup

- **Hardware:** Intel Core i7-13700K, 32 GB DDR5 RAM, 1 TB NVMe SSD
- **OS:** Windows 11 23H2 (all updates applied)
- **Baseline:** All measurements taken with no antivirus installed, then repeated with Kaspersky Premium active

### System Performance Results

| Benchmark | No Antivirus | Kaspersky Installed | Impact |
|-----------|-------------|---------------------|--------|
| **Boot time** | 14.2 sec | 15.3 sec | +7.7% |
| **File copy (5 GB)** | 18.4 sec | 19.4 sec | +5.4% |
| **App launch (Office suite)** | 2.1 sec | 2.25 sec | +7.1% |
| **Web browsing (page load avg)** | 1.3 sec | 1.38 sec | +6.2% |
| **Full system scan time** | N/A | 28 min 45 sec | — |
| **Quick scan time** | N/A | 4 min 18 sec | — |
| **Idle RAM usage** | N/A | 220 MB | — |
| **Scan RAM usage** | N/A | 410 MB | — |

### Performance Verdict

Kaspersky's impact falls in the 5-8% range across common tasks, which is noticeable in benchmarks but unlikely to be felt during everyday use on modern hardware. Boot time and app launches show the most impact. On older or lower-spec machines, the difference may be more perceptible.

**Compared to competitors:**

| Metric | Kaspersky | Bitdefender | ESET |
|--------|-----------|-------------|------|
| Boot time impact | +7.7% | +6.3% | +5.8% |
| File copy impact | +5.4% | +3.8% | +4.2% |
| Idle RAM | 220 MB | 180 MB | 165 MB |
| Full scan time | 28 min 45 sec | 22 min 14 sec | 25 min 30 sec |

Kaspersky is slightly heavier than both Bitdefender and ESET. The difference is marginal on modern hardware, but if system performance is your top priority and you're running on older or budget hardware, [Bitdefender](/posts/bitdefender-review-2026/) or <a href="https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?mid=18785&id=2776410" rel="nofollow sponsored" target="_blank">ESET</a> are lighter alternatives.

## Pricing and Plans

Kaspersky restructured its product line in recent years, replacing the old Anti-Virus / Internet Security / Total Security naming with a simpler Standard / Plus / Premium structure.

| Plan | Devices | Annual Price | Key Features |
|------|---------|-------------|--------------|
| **Kaspersky Standard** | 3 | $34.99/yr | Real-time protection, web protection, firewall, Safe Money, 300 MB/day VPN, 15-entry password manager |
| **Kaspersky Plus** | 5 | $49.99/yr | Everything in Standard + unlimited password manager, network monitor, data leak checker, basic Safe Kids |
| **Kaspersky Premium** | 5-10 | $54.99/yr | Everything in Plus + unlimited VPN, full Safe Kids, identity protection, premium tech support, remote IT support |

### Which Plan Should You Choose?

**Kaspersky Plus** is the sweet spot for most users. It unlocks the unlimited password manager and the data leak checker, both of which are significant upgrades over the Standard plan's limitations. The 300 MB/day VPN cap is manageable if you only use it for occasional public Wi-Fi protection.

**Kaspersky Premium** is worth the step up if you want the unlimited VPN (saving you a separate VPN subscription), the full parental controls suite, or the identity protection features. At $54.99/year for up to 10 devices, it's competitive with comparable tiers from Norton and Bitdefender.

**Kaspersky Standard** is the budget entry point and covers the core protection features well. The 15-entry password manager limit is a significant restriction, though — most people have far more than 15 accounts to manage.

### Renewal Pricing

Kaspersky's renewal pricing is more stable than many competitors. While introductory discounts are common, the standard listed prices are what you'll typically pay upon renewal. Kaspersky does not practice the aggressive price doubling on renewal that Norton and Bitdefender are known for, which is a meaningful advantage for long-term value.

## User Interface and Ease of Use

Kaspersky's interface is one of the cleanest in the industry. The main dashboard presents your security status prominently with a large status indicator and quick-access tiles for key features: Scan, Database Update, Safe Money, Password Manager, and VPN.

The design philosophy is "simple by default, powerful when needed." The home screen shows what matters at a glance without overwhelming new users. Clicking into any feature reveals progressively more detail and configuration options. Advanced users can access granular settings for every component — scan schedules, exclusion lists, firewall rules, application trust levels, and more.

**Installation** is straightforward and takes about five minutes. Kaspersky automatically detects and offers to remove conflicting security software during setup. The software prompts you to create a My Kaspersky account, which serves as a central management portal for all your devices and subscriptions.

The **My Kaspersky web portal** is where you manage devices remotely, configure parental controls, check data leak alerts, and handle subscription management. It's well-designed and responsive.

**Mobile apps** are solid. The Android app includes real-time protection, anti-theft features, app lock, and web protection. The iOS app covers web protection, VPN, and password management, but lacks the deeper system-level features available on Android due to Apple's platform restrictions.

One interface criticism: Kaspersky occasionally displays promotional notifications for feature upgrades or cross-sell offers. These can be disabled in settings, but they shouldn't be there by default.

## Kaspersky vs Bitdefender vs ESET: Head-to-Head

These three products are frequently compared by users who want top-tier protection. Here's how they stack up:

| Feature | Kaspersky Premium | Bitdefender Total Security | ESET Smart Security Premium |
|---------|-------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|
| **AV-TEST Score (Protection)** | 6/6 | 6/6 | 6/6 |
| **AV-Comparatives Detection** | 99.9% | 99.9% | 99.6% |
| **Performance Impact** | Low-Moderate (5-8%) | Minimal (3-6%) | Minimal (4-6%) |
| **Idle RAM Usage** | 220 MB | 180 MB | 165 MB |
| **Devices Covered** | 5-10 | 5 | 5 |
| **Platforms** | Win, Mac, Android, iOS | Win, Mac, Android, iOS | Win, Mac, Android, iOS |
| **VPN** | Unlimited (Premium) | 200 MB/day (limited) | Not included |
| **Password Manager** | Unlimited (Plus/Premium) | Yes | Yes |
| **Banking Protection** | Yes (Safe Money) | No | Yes (Banking & Payment Protection) |
| **Ransomware Remediation** | Behavioral blocking only | Yes (backup + restore) | Behavioral blocking only |
| **Parental Controls** | Yes (Safe Kids — excellent) | Yes | Basic |
| **Geopolitical Concerns** | Yes — US ban, government restrictions | No | No |
| **Configurability** | Good | Good | Excellent |
| **First-Year Price** | $54.99/yr | $39.99/yr | $59.99/yr |
| **Renewal Price** | ~$54.99/yr | ~$89.99/yr | ~$59.99/yr |

### The Verdict on Each

**Kaspersky Premium** offers the best detection engine, the best anti-phishing module, the best banking protection (Safe Money), and the most stable renewal pricing. Its unlimited VPN on the Premium tier is a genuine value-add. The geopolitical concerns and US ban are the only significant drawbacks, but they are significant for some users.

**<a href="https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?mid=11660&id=2776410" rel="nofollow sponsored" target="_blank">Bitdefender Total Security</a>** wins on system performance and first-year pricing. Its ransomware remediation (automatic backup and restore) is superior to Kaspersky's behavioral-blocking-only approach. It carries no geopolitical baggage. The main weakness is the VPN data cap and the steep renewal price jump.

**<a href="https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?mid=18785&id=2776410" rel="nofollow sponsored" target="_blank">ESET Smart Security Premium</a>** is the lightest of the three and offers the most granular configurability. It's the choice for power users who want to fine-tune every setting. Its consistent renewal pricing (same as first-year price) is a standout advantage. The main weakness is a slightly lower detection rate and basic parental controls.

**Our recommendation:** [Bitdefender](/posts/bitdefender-review-2026/) for most users — it offers the best balance of protection, performance, and trust. Kaspersky if you want the best detection engine and are comfortable with the geopolitical context. ESET if you want the lightest footprint and the most control.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is Kaspersky safe to use in 2026?

From a technical standpoint, yes. Independent audits (including SOC 2 Type 2 audits by a Big Four firm) and source code reviews conducted at Kaspersky's Transparency Centers have found no evidence of backdoors, data misuse, or unauthorized government access. Kaspersky's data processing for European and many other regions has been moved to Switzerland, adding an additional layer of jurisdictional protection.

The US government ban is based on the theoretical risk of Russian government compulsion under Russian law, not on evidence of actual misuse. Whether that theoretical risk is acceptable to you is a personal judgment call. We lay out the full details in our controversy section above so you can decide for yourself.

### Is Kaspersky banned?

Kaspersky is banned from sale in the United States as of September 29, 2024, by order of the US Department of Commerce. It was already banned from US government systems since 2017. Several EU countries have banned or discouraged Kaspersky use on government systems, but no EU country has banned consumer sales.

If you're outside the US, Kaspersky remains available for purchase and is used by hundreds of millions of people worldwide. The ban is US-specific and driven by geopolitical concerns rather than proven technical evidence of wrongdoing.

### How does Kaspersky compare to Bitdefender?

Both are excellent. Kaspersky and Bitdefender trade blows for the top detection scores in virtually every independent lab test. The key differences:

- **Performance:** Bitdefender is slightly lighter on system resources
- **Ransomware:** Bitdefender offers automatic file backup and restore; Kaspersky relies on behavioral blocking
- **Banking:** Kaspersky's Safe Money is superior to anything Bitdefender offers
- **VPN:** Kaspersky Premium includes unlimited VPN; Bitdefender's base plan caps at 200 MB/day
- **Pricing:** Bitdefender is cheaper in year one but more expensive on renewal; Kaspersky's pricing is more stable
- **Trust:** Bitdefender (Romanian company, EU-based) carries no geopolitical concerns

For most users, we recommend [Bitdefender](/posts/bitdefender-review-2026/) as the safer overall choice. But if detection excellence and banking protection are your top priorities, Kaspersky is technically the stronger product.

### Does Kaspersky sell your data?

Kaspersky's privacy policy states that anonymized threat data (such as malware samples and suspicious file hashes) is shared with the Kaspersky Security Network (KSN) to improve threat detection globally. You can opt out of KSN participation during installation. Personal user data is not sold to third parties.

Since 2018, customer data from Europe and several other regions is processed and stored in Kaspersky's Zurich-based data centers, subject to Swiss data protection laws. Independent audits have confirmed that data handling practices align with Kaspersky's stated policies.

### Can I still use Kaspersky if I'm in the US?

No. As of September 29, 2024, Kaspersky cannot be sold to US consumers or businesses, and Kaspersky has stopped providing software updates to US-based installations. If you're a US-based user with an existing Kaspersky installation, you should uninstall it and switch to an alternative immediately, as a security product without updates is a liability rather than a protection.

We recommend [Bitdefender Total Security](/posts/bitdefender-review-2026/) or [ESET Smart Security](https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?mid=18785&id=2776410){rel="nofollow sponsored"} as the closest alternatives in terms of detection quality. See our [Best Antivirus Software 2026](/posts/best-antivirus-software-2026/) guide for the full list.

### Is Kaspersky good for gaming?

Yes. Kaspersky includes a Gaming Mode that suppresses notifications, defers non-critical scans, and reduces background resource usage when a full-screen application is detected. In our testing, Gaming Mode reduced Kaspersky's performance impact to near-zero during gameplay. Frame rates were not measurably affected in our benchmarks.

### Does Kaspersky work with other security software?

Kaspersky is designed to be your primary security solution and may conflict with other real-time antivirus products. It will prompt you to remove conflicting software during installation. However, it can coexist with on-demand scanners like Malwarebytes Free (when Malwarebytes' real-time protection is disabled) for second-opinion scanning.

## Final Verdict

Kaspersky earns an **8.5 out of 10** in our 2026 review. The 1.5 points it loses compared to our top-rated [Bitdefender (9.5/10)](/posts/bitdefender-review-2026/) are almost entirely attributable to the geopolitical situation — not to any technical shortcoming.

On pure technical merit, Kaspersky's detection engine is arguably the best in the industry. Its anti-phishing protection is outstanding. Safe Money is the best banking protection feature available in any consumer antivirus. The feature set is comprehensive, the interface is clean, and the pricing is fair and stable.

But we can't ignore the context. The US ban is real. Government restrictions across multiple countries are real. The theoretical legal risk under Russian law is real. And while independent audits have found nothing wrong, the burden of proof in matters of trust is different from the burden of proof in a lab test.

If you're outside the US, have reviewed the transparency measures, and are comfortable with your decision, Kaspersky Premium is an excellent choice that will protect your devices as well as or better than anything else on the market. If the geopolitical dimension gives you pause, Bitdefender and ESET are outstanding alternatives with no such complications.

Security software requires trust. Make sure you're choosing a product you trust completely.
