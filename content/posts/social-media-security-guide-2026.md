faq:
  - q: "How do social media accounts get hacked?"
    a: "The most common methods: phishing (fake login pages sent via DM or email), credential stuffing (using leaked passwords from other breaches), SIM swapping (taking over your phone number for 2FA), malicious apps (third-party apps with excessive permissions), and social engineering (tricking support staff into resetting your account)."
  - q: "What should I do if my social media account is hacked?"
    a: "Immediately: (1) Try to reset your password via email. (2) Revoke access from all devices via the platform's security settings. (3) Enable 2FA if not already active. (4) Check and remove unknown connected apps. (5) Report the hack to the platform. (6) Alert your contacts about potential scam messages sent from your account."
  - q: "Is two-factor authentication enough to protect my accounts?"
    a: "2FA significantly reduces risk but isn't foolproof. SMS-based 2FA can be bypassed via SIM swapping. Use authenticator apps (Google Authenticator, Authy) or hardware keys (YubiKey) for stronger protection. Combine 2FA with unique passwords, login alerts, and regular security checkups."
  - q: "Should I use a password manager for social media?"
    a: "Absolutely. A password manager generates and stores unique, complex passwords for each platform. Since credential stuffing (using leaked passwords across sites) is the #1 attack vector, unique passwords per site eliminate this risk entirely. NordPass or 1Password are excellent choices."
  - q: "How can I check if my social media data has been leaked?"
    a: "Check haveibeenpwned.com — enter your email to see if it appears in known data breaches. Also check your platform's security settings for unrecognized login attempts. Most platforms (Facebook, Google, Instagram) have a 'Security Checkup' feature that reviews your account security."
  - q: "What privacy settings should I change on social media?"
    a: "Essential changes: set your profile to private (or friends-only), disable location sharing, limit who can see your friends list, turn off facial recognition, review and remove third-party app connections, disable search engine indexing of your profile, and restrict who can send you DMs/friend requests."

A friend of mine had their Instagram hacked last year, and within hours the attacker was DMing everyone in their contact list with a crypto scam. The damage was not just personal -- it burned trust with dozens of people. Your social media accounts hold more data than you think, and a compromised account turns you into a weapon against everyone you know. Here is how I lock down every platform, and you can do it in under 30 minutes.

## Universal Security Checklist

Before diving into platform-specific settings, apply these to every social media account:

### 1. Use Unique Passwords
Every account needs a different, complex password. Use <a href="https://go.nordpass.io/aff_c?offer_id=488&aff_id=141337&url_id=32468" rel="nofollow sponsored" target="_blank">NordPass</a> or another password manager to generate and store them.

### 2. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

| 2FA Method | Security Level | Convenience |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| **Hardware key (YubiKey)** | Highest | Low (need physical key) |
| **Authenticator app** | High | Medium |
| **SMS code** | Medium | High |
| **Email code** | Low-Medium | High |

**Recommendation:** Use an authenticator app (Google Authenticator, Authy, or your password manager's built-in TOTP) for all accounts.

### 3. Review Connected Apps
Third-party apps with access to your accounts are a major attack vector. Remove any you don't actively use.

### 4. Enable Login Alerts
Get notified when someone logs into your account from a new device or location.

### 5. Check Active Sessions
Regularly review which devices are logged into your accounts and remove unknown ones.

## Red Flags: Signs Your Account Is Compromised

Watch for these warning signs:
- Posts, messages, or follows you didn't make
- Login alerts from unknown locations or devices
- Friends receiving spam messages from your account
- Password changed without your knowledge
- Email address or phone number changed
- Unknown apps connected to your account
- Account temporarily locked by the platform

## What to Do If You're Hacked

### Immediate Steps (First 15 Minutes)
1. **Reset your password** from a trusted device
2. **Enable 2FA** immediately if not already active
3. **End all sessions** except your current device
4. **Check email** — has the recovery email been changed?
5. **Remove unknown apps** and connections

### Next Steps (Within 24 Hours)
1. **Change passwords** on other accounts that used the same password
2. **Alert your contacts** about potential scam messages
3. **Report to the platform** via their official help center
4. **Check financial accounts** if payment info was stored
5. **Run a malware scan** on your devices

### If You Can't Access Your Account
1. Use the platform's official account recovery process
2. Provide identity verification if requested
3. Contact platform support with proof of ownership
4. File a report at identitytheft.gov (US) or your local authority

## Advanced Protection

### Use a VPN on Public Wi-Fi
When checking social media on public networks, use <a href="https://go.nordvpn.net/aff_c?offer_id=612&aff_id=141337&url_id=25704" rel="nofollow sponsored" target="_blank">NordVPN</a> to encrypt your connection and prevent session hijacking.

### Separate Email for Social Media
Create a dedicated email address for your social media accounts. If one is compromised, your primary email stays safe.

### Regular Security Audits
Schedule a monthly 10-minute checkup:
- Review active sessions
- Check connected apps
- Update any reused passwords
- Review privacy settings (platforms change defaults)

## Conclusion

Securing your social media takes 30 minutes upfront and 10 minutes per month to maintain. The three most impactful actions: unique passwords with a password manager, authenticator-based 2FA on every account, and regular review of connected apps and active sessions.
