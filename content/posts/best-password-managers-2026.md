## Why You Need a Password Manager (The Brutal Truth)

Here are the facts:

- **81% of data breaches** are caused by weak or reused passwords
- The average data breach costs victims **$4.45 million** (IBM, 2025)
- **65% of people** reuse passwords across multiple accounts
- A hacker who gets your email password likely has access to **everything**

A password manager eliminates this risk entirely. One master password. Unique passwords for everything else. Done.

## How to Switch to a Password Manager

1. **Pick one** from our list above (we recommend 1Password or Bitwarden)
2. **Install the browser extension** and mobile app
3. **Import existing passwords** from your browser (all managers support this)
4. **Start changing your worst passwords** — Focus on email, banking, and social media first
5. **Enable 2FA** on your most important accounts
6. **Over time**, let the manager generate new passwords as you log into sites

The whole process takes about 30 minutes to set up and a few weeks to fully migrate.
