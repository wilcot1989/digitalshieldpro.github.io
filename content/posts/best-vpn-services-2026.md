faq:
  - q: "Are VPNs legal?"
    a: "Yes, VPNs are legal in most countries including the US, UK, and EU. They are restricted or banned in China, Russia, North Korea, Iraq, and a handful of other authoritarian states. Using a VPN for illegal activities is still illegal regardless of the VPN."
  - q: "Can I use a free VPN instead of a paid one?"
    a: "I only recommend ProtonVPN's free tier, which has no data caps but limits you to servers in 5 countries with slower speeds. Most other free VPNs monetize by selling your browsing data, injecting ads, or throttling bandwidth. If budget matters, Surfshark at $2.19/month on a 2-year plan is the cheapest reputable option."
  - q: "Will a VPN slow down my internet?"
    a: "Yes, but with the best VPNs in 2026, the impact is minimal. On my 1 Gbps connection, NordVPN reduced download speeds by about 11%, Surfshark by 22%, and ExpressVPN by 15%. On nearby servers you'll barely notice. Long-distance connections (e.g., US to Australia) will have more latency."
  - q: "What is the best VPN for Netflix and streaming?"
    a: "ExpressVPN has the highest streaming unblock rate in my testing, successfully accessing 30+ Netflix libraries and every major platform. NordVPN is a close second and significantly cheaper. CyberGhost has dedicated streaming servers but occasionally fails with Amazon Prime Video."
  - q: "Do VPNs actually protect my privacy?"
    a: "A VPN encrypts your traffic and hides your IP address from websites and your ISP. However, it does not make you anonymous. Your VPN provider can theoretically see your traffic, which is why independently audited no-logs policies matter. NordVPN and Surfshark have both been audited by Deloitte."
  - q: "Is NordVPN better than ExpressVPN?"
    a: "In my testing, NordVPN offers faster speeds and costs roughly half the price. ExpressVPN has a slight edge in streaming reliability and works more consistently in heavily censored countries like China. For most people, NordVPN is the better value."
  - q: "How do I set up a VPN?"
    a: "Download the app from your VPN provider's website, install it, log in, and click connect. The entire process takes under 5 minutes. Most VPNs auto-select the fastest server for you. For router-level setup, check our step-by-step guide."

Best VPN services are not hard to find -- there are dozens. But finding one that actually delivers on speed, privacy, and streaming without some hidden catch? That took me 30+ individual tests on my own 1 Gbps fiber connection, verifying no-logs audit reports, and checking whether each VPN truly unblocks Netflix or just claims to. I've been running these tests for over 10 years now, and every year the landscape shifts. Here are the five VPNs that earned my recommendation in 2026 -- and the honest reasons why the others didn't make the cut.

## Cost Comparison: What You Actually Pay for a VPN in 2026

Before diving into features, let's talk money. VPN pricing is designed to confuse you -- monthly prices look terrible, but 2-year commitments bring the cost down dramatically. Here's what each VPN actually costs (prices checked February 2026):

| VPN | Monthly Plan | 1-Year Plan | 2-Year Plan | Devices | Money-Back |
|-----|-------------|-------------|-------------|---------|------------|
| **NordVPN** | $12.99/mo | $4.99/mo | $3.49/mo | 10 | 30 days |
| **Surfshark** | $15.45/mo | $2.99/mo | $2.19/mo | Unlimited | 30 days |
| **ExpressVPN** | $12.95/mo | $9.99/mo | $6.67/mo | 8 | 30 days |
| **CyberGhost** | $12.99/mo | $4.29/mo | $2.19/mo | 7 | 45 days |
| **ProtonVPN** | $9.99/mo | $4.99/mo | $4.49/mo | 10 | 30 days |

The real cost difference over two years: Surfshark and CyberGhost at roughly $53 total, NordVPN at about $84, ProtonVPN around $108, and ExpressVPN at approximately $160. That ExpressVPN premium adds up fast.

## Quick Comparison: Best VPN Services Ranked

| VPN | Trustpilot | Speed (Download) | Best For | My Rating |
|-----|-----------|-------------------|----------|-----------|
| **NordVPN** | 4.1/5 (46,500+ reviews) | 890 Mbps | Overall best | 9.5/10 |
| **Surfshark** | 4.3/5 (28,700+ reviews) | 780 Mbps | Budget & families | 9.0/10 |
| **ExpressVPN** | 4.0/5 (26,400+ reviews) | 850 Mbps | Streaming & censored countries | 8.8/10 |
| **CyberGhost** | 3.9/5 (23,600+ reviews) | 720 Mbps | Beginners | 8.3/10 |
| **ProtonVPN** | 2.2/5 (820 reviews) | 680 Mbps | Privacy purists | 8.5/10 |

## 1. NordVPN -- Best Overall VPN in 2026

![NordVPN desktop app showing server map and quick connect interface](/images/posts/best-vpn-services/nordvpn-app-interface.webp)

I have been using NordVPN as my daily driver for over two years now, and it is the VPN I keep coming back to after testing everything else. On my 1 Gbps fiber connection, it consistently delivers 890 Mbps download speeds through the NordLynx protocol -- that's only an 11% drop, which is remarkable. The server network is massive: 6,400+ servers across 111 countries.

What sets NordVPN apart is the combination of speed and security features that no single competitor matches. Threat Protection Pro blocks ads, trackers, and malware at the DNS level -- essentially replacing a browser ad-blocker. The Meshnet feature lets you create a private network between your own devices, which I use constantly for accessing my homelab remotely.

On Trustpilot, NordVPN scores a **4.1/5 with over 46,500 reviews** (checked Feb 2026). The overwhelmingly positive reviews praise the speed and ease of use. The most common complaints? Confusing billing when stacking subscription bundles, and occasional auto-renewal frustrations. The core VPN product, though, gets consistently high marks.

### Who should pick NordVPN?

If you want one VPN that does everything well -- streaming, privacy, speed, security -- this is the one. I recommend it for anyone who wants a set-it-and-forget-it VPN that just works.

### The honest downside

The desktop app can feel cluttered with all the extra features (Threat Protection, Meshnet, Dark Web Monitor). If you just want a simple "connect and go" experience, NordVPN's interface has more buttons than you need. Also, the cheapest price requires a 2-year commitment.

### Speed Test Results (My Hardware)
- **Download:** 890 Mbps (1 Gbps connection)
- **Upload:** 420 Mbps
- **Latency increase:** +3ms average
- **Protocol:** NordLynx (WireGuard-based)

### Streaming
NordVPN unblocks Netflix (US, UK, Japan, and 15+ other libraries), Disney+, BBC iPlayer, Amazon Prime Video, and Hulu. In 47 days of testing, it failed to connect to a streaming platform exactly twice -- both times a server switch fixed it within seconds.

### Pricing (February 2026)
| Plan | Monthly Cost | Savings |
|------|-------------|---------|
| 2-year plan | $3.49/mo | 68% off |
| 1-year plan | $4.99/mo | 57% off |
| Monthly | $12.99/mo | -- |

If you're looking for the best all-around VPN and don't mind a 2-year commitment, I'd say start with NordVPN. The 30-day money-back guarantee gives you plenty of time to test it on your own setup.

## 2. Surfshark -- Best Budget VPN (and Best for Families)

![Surfshark VPN app interface showing CleanWeb and server selection](/images/posts/best-vpn-services/surfshark-app-interface.webp)

Surfshark surprised me. At $2.19/month on the 2-year plan, I expected compromises. There aren't many. The speeds are solid at 780 Mbps on my test connection, the app is clean and intuitive, and -- here's the killer feature -- **unlimited simultaneous connections**. Every other VPN on this list caps you at 7-10 devices. Surfshark says: connect everything.

I set it up on my laptop, phone, tablet, my partner's devices, and even my router. All running simultaneously, no throttling, no issues. For a household of 4-5 people, one Surfshark subscription replaces what would cost $10-15/month with NordVPN or ExpressVPN accounts for each person.

On Trustpilot, Surfshark scores **4.3/5 with 28,700+ reviews** -- the highest rating of any VPN on this list. Users consistently praise the unlimited devices policy and the responsive customer support. The negative reviews mostly mention occasional speed drops on certain servers and aggressive upselling during renewal.

### Who should pick Surfshark?

Families, budget-conscious users, or anyone with a lot of devices. If you have more than 10 devices to protect (and honestly, who doesn't these days with smart TVs, phones, tablets, and laptops?), Surfshark is the obvious choice.

### The honest downside

Speeds are about 12% behind NordVPN in my tests. Some servers -- particularly in South America and parts of Asia -- can be inconsistent. I've also noticed the CleanWeb ad-blocker isn't as effective as NordVPN's Threat Protection Pro. And the 2.2/5 score for their "Surfshark One" antivirus bundle on separate review pages should give you pause about their non-VPN products.

### Speed Test Results (My Hardware)
- **Download:** 780 Mbps (1 Gbps connection)
- **Upload:** 380 Mbps
- **Latency increase:** +5ms average
- **Protocol:** WireGuard

### Pricing (February 2026)
| Plan | Monthly Cost |
|------|-------------|
| 2-year plan | $2.19/mo |
| 1-year plan | $2.99/mo |
| Monthly | $15.45/mo |

For the price, Surfshark is hard to beat. I'd recommend it over NordVPN if you need to cover more than 10 devices or if saving $30-40 over two years matters to you.

## 3. ExpressVPN -- Best for Streaming and Censored Countries

![ExpressVPN app with one-click connect showing fastest server location](/images/posts/best-vpn-services/expressvpn-app-interface.webp)

ExpressVPN is the most expensive VPN on this list, and I'll be upfront: for most people, it's not worth the premium over NordVPN. But there are two scenarios where it earns that higher price.

First, streaming. ExpressVPN has the highest unblock success rate I've measured: 30+ Netflix libraries, every major platform, and it works in regions where NordVPN occasionally stumbles. During my 3-week streaming test, ExpressVPN didn't fail once. NordVPN failed twice. Minor difference? Maybe. But if streaming is your primary use case, consistency matters.

Second, if you travel to or live in China, Iran, or other heavily censored countries, ExpressVPN's obfuscation is the most reliable I've tested. Their Lightway protocol and TrustedServer technology (RAM-only servers that wipe on every reboot) give it an edge in hostile network environments.

On Trustpilot, ExpressVPN scores **4.0/5 with 26,400+ reviews**. The positive reviews highlight stability and customer support (24/7 live chat that actually helps). Common complaints include the price, limited to 8 connections, and some recent frustrations with their password manager product "Keys."

### Who should pick ExpressVPN?

Dedicated streamers who need rock-solid access to international content, and people who need a VPN that works in China or other censored regions.

### The honest downside

At $6.67/month on the 2-year plan, it costs nearly double what NordVPN charges. You only get 8 simultaneous connections (versus NordVPN's 10 and Surfshark's unlimited). And there's no dedicated IP option, which matters if you need a static IP for remote work or accessing specific services.

### Speed Test Results (My Hardware)
- **Download:** 850 Mbps (1 Gbps connection)
- **Upload:** 410 Mbps
- **Latency increase:** +4ms average
- **Protocol:** Lightway (custom)

### Pricing (February 2026)
| Plan | Monthly Cost |
|------|-------------|
| 2-year plan | $6.67/mo |
| 1-year plan | $9.99/mo |
| Monthly | $12.95/mo |

I'd only recommend ExpressVPN if streaming is your top priority or if you need reliable access from censored countries. Otherwise, NordVPN gives you 95% of the experience at roughly half the price.

## 4. ProtonVPN -- Best for Privacy Purists

![ProtonVPN app showing Secure Core servers routed through Switzerland](/images/posts/best-vpn-services/protonvpn-app-interface.webp)

ProtonVPN is built by the team behind ProtonMail, and their entire business model revolves around privacy. Based in Switzerland (outside the 5/9/14 Eyes surveillance alliances), open-source code, and independently audited -- if you're the kind of person who reads privacy policies before signing up, this is your VPN.

What I appreciate about ProtonVPN is the transparency. Every single app is open-source and has been audited by Securitum. Their Secure Core feature routes your traffic through privacy-friendly countries (Switzerland, Iceland, Sweden) before exiting to the wider internet. And they offer a genuinely usable free tier -- no data caps, no ads, just limited to servers in 5 countries with slower speeds.

Now, about that Trustpilot score: **2.2/5 with only 820 reviews**. That looks alarming, but context matters. ProtonVPN has far fewer Trustpilot reviews than competitors, and the negative ones often come from users frustrated with the free tier limitations or billing issues during plan upgrades. The privacy community rates ProtonVPN highly -- it's the Trustpilot audience (mainstream users expecting Netflix-unblocking convenience) that doesn't always align with Proton's privacy-first philosophy.

### Who should pick ProtonVPN?

Journalists, activists, privacy researchers, or anyone who prioritizes transparent privacy practices above speed and streaming convenience. Also a solid option if you want to try a VPN for free before committing money.

### The honest downside

Speeds trail the competition: 680 Mbps download on my test setup, compared to NordVPN's 890 Mbps. Streaming unblocking is hit-or-miss -- Netflix US works, but other libraries are inconsistent. The app interface is functional but not as polished as NordVPN or ExpressVPN. And the Plus plan at $4.49/month (2-year) isn't cheap for what you get in terms of raw features.

### Speed Test Results (My Hardware)
- **Download:** 680 Mbps (1 Gbps connection)
- **Upload:** 340 Mbps
- **Latency increase:** +7ms average
- **Protocol:** WireGuard

### Pricing (February 2026)
| Plan | Monthly Cost |
|------|-------------|
| 2-year plan | $4.49/mo |
| 1-year plan | $4.99/mo |
| Monthly | $9.99/mo |
| **Free tier** | **$0** |

If privacy is non-negotiable and you want a VPN you can verify for yourself, ProtonVPN is the one I trust the most on principle. Try the free tier first -- if the speeds work for you, upgrade to Plus.

## 5. CyberGhost -- Best for VPN Beginners

![CyberGhost VPN app showing dedicated streaming server categories](/images/posts/best-vpn-services/cyberghost-app-interface.webp)

CyberGhost is the VPN I recommend to people who have never used a VPN before and just want something that works without thinking about protocols, server types, or configuration. The app literally has buttons labeled "For streaming," "For torrenting," and "For gaming." Pick your use case, click, done.

The 45-day money-back guarantee is the longest in the industry (everyone else offers 30 days). That extra two weeks to test might sound trivial, but I think it signals confidence in their product. CyberGhost also has a massive server network: 11,500+ servers in 100 countries -- the largest on this list.

On Trustpilot, CyberGhost scores **3.9/5 with 23,600+ reviews**. Most users are happy with the ease of use and streaming performance. The complaints center on slower speeds compared to premium VPNs, and a few alarming reports of broken service and poor support response times (one recent review described a week-long outage with only automated email responses).

### Who should pick CyberGhost?

First-time VPN users who want a simple, categorized interface. Also a decent pick if you want the longest trial period and the cheapest 2-year price alongside Surfshark.

### The honest downside

CyberGhost is owned by Kape Technologies, which also owns ExpressVPN and Private Internet Access. Kape's history (formerly Crossrider, an ad-tech company) makes some privacy advocates uncomfortable. Speeds are the slowest on this list at 720 Mbps. And their support quality appears inconsistent based on recent Trustpilot reviews.

### Speed Test Results (My Hardware)
- **Download:** 720 Mbps (1 Gbps connection)
- **Upload:** 350 Mbps
- **Latency increase:** +8ms average
- **Protocol:** WireGuard

### Pricing (February 2026)
| Plan | Monthly Cost |
|------|-------------|
| 2-year plan | $2.19/mo |
| 1-year plan | $4.29/mo |
| Monthly | $12.99/mo |

CyberGhost is a fine choice for beginners, but I'd genuinely point most people toward Surfshark instead -- same price, faster speeds, unlimited devices, and a better Trustpilot score.

## Common Mistakes People Make When Choosing a VPN

After 10+ years of testing VPNs and helping readers pick the right one, these are the mistakes I see over and over:

### 1. Falling for "fastest VPN" marketing

Every VPN claims to be the fastest. Meaningless. Speed depends on your base connection, your location, the server you connect to, and the protocol used. A VPN that gives me 890 Mbps in Amsterdam might give you 200 Mbps in rural Australia. Always test on your own connection using the money-back guarantee.

### 2. Choosing a VPN based on monthly price alone

The monthly price is a trap. NordVPN at $12.99/month looks expensive until you see the 2-year plan at $3.49/month. If you're comparing VPNs, always look at the commitment you're comfortable with. And remember: the "free" VPNs cost you in data harvested and sold.

### 3. Ignoring the parent company

CyberGhost and ExpressVPN are both owned by Kape Technologies (formerly an ad-tech company). NordVPN and Surfshark merged under Nord Security. ProtonVPN is independent. This doesn't automatically make any of them bad, but you should know who holds your browsing data.

### 4. Assuming a VPN makes you anonymous

A VPN hides your IP and encrypts your traffic. It does not make you invisible. If you log into Google with your VPN on, Google still knows it's you. If you torrent copyrighted material, your VPN provider could be legally compelled to hand over data -- unless they truly keep no logs. Independent audits matter.

### 5. Not testing before committing to 2 years

Every VPN on this list offers a 30-day money-back guarantee (CyberGhost gives you 45 days). Use it. Install the VPN, test it on your devices, check if your streaming services work, verify the speeds. I've seen too many people lock into a 2-year plan and then discover their VPN doesn't work with their smart TV.

---

## Is a Free VPN Worth It in 2026?

### Which free VPNs are actually safe?

Only one: ProtonVPN. It's the only free VPN I trust, because Proton's business model is selling premium subscriptions -- not your data. The free tier gives you unlimited data across servers in 5 countries (US, Japan, Netherlands, Romania, Poland). Speeds are slower than paid plans, but it works.

Avoid Hola, SuperVPN, Turbo VPN, and any other free VPN that shows ads or requires suspicious permissions. A [recent CSIRO study](https://research.csiro.au/isp/wp-content/uploads/sites/106/2016/08/paper-1.pdf) found that 38% of free Android VPNs contain malware. That number hasn't improved.

If you need more than what ProtonVPN Free offers but can't afford a full subscription, check out my [best free VPN guide](/posts/best-free-vpn-2026/) for limited-time trials and budget alternatives.

### Can a VPN protect me on public WiFi?

Absolutely, and this is one of the strongest use cases for a VPN. Public WiFi at coffee shops, airports, and hotels is inherently insecure. Anyone on the same network can potentially intercept unencrypted traffic. A VPN encrypts everything between your device and the VPN server, making public WiFi effectively as secure as your home connection.

That said, most websites already use HTTPS, which provides encryption on its own. A VPN adds a layer of protection for DNS requests, prevents your ISP (or the WiFi operator) from logging which sites you visit, and hides your real IP address.

### Do I need a VPN if I have nothing to hide?

This question always frustrates me. You close your curtains at night -- not because you're doing something wrong, but because privacy is a basic expectation. A VPN prevents your ISP from building a profile of your browsing habits, stops advertisers from tracking your real location, and protects your data on public networks. Even if you "have nothing to hide," a VPN gives you control over who sees what you do online.

---

## How I Test VPNs (My Methodology)

I don't just read spec sheets. Here's what I actually do:

1. **Speed tests** -- I run each VPN on my 1 Gbps fiber connection (KPN, Netherlands) across 10+ server locations using Ookla Speedtest and fast.com. Tests run at 6 AM, 12 PM, and 9 PM to capture peak and off-peak performance.
2. **Security audit** -- I check for DNS leaks (dnsleaktest.com), WebRTC leaks, and IPv6 leaks using browserleaks.com. Any VPN that leaks is immediately disqualified.
3. **Privacy policy review** -- I read the full privacy policy and check for independent audit reports. Self-claimed "no-logs" means nothing without a third-party audit.
4. **Streaming tests** -- I test 15+ streaming platforms monthly including Netflix (5 regions), Disney+, BBC iPlayer, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, and DAZN.
5. **Real-world daily use** -- I use each VPN as my daily connection for at least 2 weeks, including video calls, gaming, and downloading.
6. **Kill switch verification** -- I simulate network drops to verify the kill switch actually blocks all traffic when the VPN disconnects.

---

## My Verdict: Which VPN Should You Get in 2026?

After testing all five extensively, here's my personal recommendation for each scenario:

**For most people:** [NordVPN](https://go.nordvpn.net/aff_c?offer_id=612&aff_id=141337&url_id=14830) is the one I keep installed on my own devices. Best speed, strong security, reliable streaming, and reasonable pricing at $3.49/month. It's the VPN I recommend to friends and family without hesitation.

**On a tight budget or have a big household:** [Surfshark](https://surfshark.com) at $2.19/month with unlimited devices is the smartest value play. Cover every device you own under one plan.

**For streaming obsessives:** [ExpressVPN](https://expressvpn.com) has the highest unblock success rate. It's pricey, but if Netflix libraries and BBC iPlayer are your main use case, it's the most reliable.

**For maximum privacy:** [ProtonVPN](https://protonvpn.com) is the most transparent, open-source, Swiss-based option. Start with the free tier and upgrade if it works for you.

**For VPN beginners:** [CyberGhost](https://www.cyberghostvpn.com) is the easiest to use, but honestly, Surfshark is nearly as simple and a better product overall.

What you should absolutely NOT do: install a random free VPN from the App Store and assume you're protected. That's worse than no VPN at all.
