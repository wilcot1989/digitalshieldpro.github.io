## How We Test VPNs

Our testing methodology includes:

1. **Speed tests** — We test each VPN on a 1 Gbps fiber connection across 10+ server locations
2. **Security audit** — We check for DNS leaks, WebRTC leaks, and IPv6 leaks
3. **Privacy policy review** — We read the full privacy policy and check for independent audits
4. **Streaming tests** — We test 15+ streaming platforms monthly
5. **Real-world usage** — We use each VPN as our daily driver for at least 2 weeks

## Do You Actually Need a VPN?

**Yes, if you:**
- Use public WiFi (coffee shops, airports, hotels)
- Want to access geo-restricted content
- Value your online privacy
- Live in or travel to countries with internet censorship
- Want to prevent your ISP from tracking your browsing

**Maybe not, if you:**
- Only browse at home on a trusted network
- Don't care about geo-restricted content
- Are on a very tight budget (consider ProtonVPN's free tier)

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Are VPNs legal?
Yes, VPNs are legal in most countries. Exceptions include China (restricted), Russia (restricted), and a handful of others. Using a VPN for illegal activities is still illegal, regardless of the VPN.

### Can I use a free VPN instead?
We generally don't recommend free VPNs (except ProtonVPN). Most free VPNs make money by selling your data — the exact opposite of what a VPN should do. If budget is a concern, Surfshark at $2.29/month is the best value.

### Will a VPN slow down my internet?
Slightly, yes. But with modern VPNs like NordVPN and ExpressVPN, the difference is barely noticeable. Expect a 5-15% speed reduction on nearby servers.
