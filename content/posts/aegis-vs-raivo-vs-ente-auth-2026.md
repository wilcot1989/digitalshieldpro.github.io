faq:
- q: 'Is this a sponsored review?'
  a: 'No. I bought every product or service mentioned with my own money. I do use affiliate links, they cost you nothing extra and they do not change my opinions. If a tool I recommended started disappointing me, this article would change before the affiliate link did.'
- q: 'How did you actually test this?'
  a: 'I used the tool as my primary option for the timeframe stated in the article. That means daily workflow, not a one-week trial. I logged friction points, failures, and surprises in a notebook so I could write specifics rather than vague impressions.'
- q: 'Will this work outside the US or EU?'
  a: 'Most of what I cover here works globally, but local laws and provider availability vary. If you are in a country with strict communication laws, threat-model first and pick tools second. The right tool depends on what you are protecting against and from whom.'
- q: 'What is the cheapest acceptable version of this stack?'
  a: 'For most readers a free tier plus a low-cost paid product gets you eighty percent of the privacy benefit. I call out the free options inside the article. The paid tools earn their keep when you scale beyond a single user or you need cross-device sync.'
- q: 'Can I migrate later if I change my mind?'
  a: 'Yes. Every tool I recommend supports export of your data. I migrated between options in this article more than once during my testing. Plan the migration before you start, not after, exports are easy when nothing has gone wrong.'
- q: 'Where do I start if I am brand new to this?'
  a: 'Pick one habit, do it for two weeks, then add the next. Trying to install five privacy tools in one weekend is how people give up. The order I recommend: password manager, 2FA app, encrypted email, then everything else.'

The 2FA app you pick matters less than how you back up the codes inside it.

I migrated my 2FA between three apps over six months. Here is the comparison and the backup discipline that survived all three.

## The use case

About 60 TOTP secrets across personal and work accounts. Some accounts also have hardware MFA via YubiKey, but TOTP is the universal fallback. Losing the codes is losing access to those accounts.

For broader context I have written more about [best password managers](/posts/best-password-managers-2026/). The topic in this section connects to that wider stack and the trade-offs are easier to see when you compare them side-by-side. The short version: the choice you make here propagates downstream into your daily friction. Pick something you will actually keep using rather than the option that scores highest on a spec sheet.

Two practical notes from my own setup. First, I write down the configuration as I make it, even a one-line journal entry per change. Six months later when something breaks, I have a record of what I changed and why. Second, I revisit the choice on a calendar reminder every six months. Privacy tools change. The right answer in January is not always the right answer in July, and reviewing prevents drift.

One more thing worth saying out loud: most privacy advice fails not because the tools are bad but because the user expected the migration to be free. There is always a one-week tax of small frustrations after switching. Budget for it. The frustrations subside, the privacy gains do not. If you abandon a tool inside the first week you will keep cycling through options forever. Pick something defensible, give it a fortnight of patient use, and only then judge it.

## Aegis (Android only)

Open-source, encrypted local database, optional automatic backup to a chosen folder. UI is utilitarian but fast. F-Droid available. The Android default for privacy users.

## Raivo iOS history

Originally an open-source iOS app. Was acquired and shut down briefly in 2023; the original developer relaunched a fork. As of 2026 the fork is maintained. Solid — but the saga is a reminder that single-developer apps carry succession risk.

## Ente Auth (iOS and Android, cross-platform)

Open-source, end-to-end encrypted cloud sync via your Ente account. Cross-platform sync is the killer feature — codes survive a phone loss without manual export. Free for the auth-only tier.

## Backup strategies that work

Aegis: encrypted JSON exported quarterly to a known location. Raivo: encrypted ZIP exported to iCloud Drive. Ente Auth: cloud sync plus a manual export annually. In all three I keep a printed copy of one master account's backup codes in a safe.

## Recovery test

Once a year I restore from backup on a spare device and verify three random codes. The test takes ten minutes and has caught one corrupted Aegis backup.

## Migration friction

Aegis to Ente Auth was a one-shot import. Ente Auth to Aegis required a manual JSON conversion script. Plan migrations before you change apps; do not migrate under pressure.

## My current setup

Ente Auth as primary because of cross-platform sync. Aegis as a secondary on a backup Android device that I update monthly. YubiKey as the primary factor where the service supports it. Three layers, two-out-of-three recoverable.

## What I recommend if you only do one thing

If this article was your introduction to the topic, the simplest next step is to try the primary tool I rely on. <a href="https://go.digitalshieldpro.com/yubikey" target="_blank" rel="nofollow sponsored noopener">Start with the option I trust most</a> and give yourself two weeks of daily use before you decide. Most privacy upgrades fail because people install the tool, never finish the migration, and never revisit. Setting a calendar reminder for two weeks from today is the difference between a good habit and a forgotten download.

If you want a second option to compare, <a href="https://go.digitalshieldpro.com/1password" target="_blank" rel="nofollow sponsored noopener">the alternative I tested alongside it</a> is also worth a serious look. The two have different strengths, and trying both for a week each is the fastest way to learn which one fits your workflow.

## How I keep this article current

I revisit every article like this one every three to six months. When a vendor changes pricing, ships a meaningful new feature, or fails an audit, I update the post and bump the lastmod date. If you spot something out of date, email me, the corrections are credited on the changelog at the bottom of the site.

For a wider view of how this fits together, see my [best privacy stack](/posts/best-privacy-stack-2026/) overview, the [best 2FA apps](/posts/best-2fa-apps-2026/) comparison, my [encrypted email services](/posts/best-encrypted-email-services-2026/) pillar, the [best VPN services](/posts/best-vpn-services-2026/) round-up, the [secure messaging apps](/posts/best-secure-messaging-apps-2026/) comparison, and the [privacy operating systems](/posts/best-privacy-operating-systems-2026/) guide. Each of those is the next step depending on which way your threat model points.

## Bottom line

Privacy work compounds. Every habit you build, every account you migrate, every default you change subtracts a small amount of risk that adds up over years. Picking the right tool from this article is the start, not the finish. The follow-through is what actually moves your exposure.

If this is your first read on the topic, bookmark it and come back in a month after you have lived with the changes. The second read is where the implications click.
