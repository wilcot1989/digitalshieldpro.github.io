After finding my own credentials in two separate breach databases last year, I stopped treating identity theft as something that happens to other people. Over **47 million Americans** were victims in 2025, and with AI making it trivially easy to clone identities, the numbers are only climbing. I now run dedicated monitoring on every personal data point I can -- and the right service has already saved me twice.
