faq:
  - q: "Is it legal to use a VPN for streaming?"
    a: "Using a VPN is legal in most countries, including the US, UK, Canada, Australia, and across the EU. However, it may violate streaming platforms' terms of service. In practice, the worst that typically happens is the service blocks your VPN connection."
  - q: "Will a VPN slow down my streaming?"
    a: "With a high-quality VPN like NordVPN, Surfshark, or ExpressVPN, the speed reduction is minimal. In our tests, the top VPNs retained 60-72% of the base connection speed, far exceeding the 25 Mbps needed for 4K streaming."
  - q: "Why does Netflix block VPNs?"
    a: "Netflix licenses content on a country-by-country basis, and content owners contractually require Netflix to enforce geo-restrictions. Netflix actively detects and blocks VPN connections to comply with these licensing agreements."
  - q: "Can I use a free VPN for streaming?"
    a: "We do not recommend free VPNs for streaming. They typically have limited server locations, data caps, slower speeds, and poor success rates with geo-blocked content. A budget option like Surfshark at $2.29/month is a far better choice."
  - q: "Which VPN is best for Netflix specifically?"
    a: "NordVPN is the best VPN for Netflix in 2026. It unblocked all 9 Netflix libraries we tested, including notoriously difficult ones like Japan and South Korea. Its SmartPlay technology is specifically designed to bypass Netflix's VPN detection."
  - q: "Will my streaming account get banned for using a VPN?"
    a: "No. Streaming platforms do not ban accounts for VPN usage. When a VPN is detected, the platform simply blocks access to content until you disconnect or switch to a non-VPN connection. Your account remains in good standing."
  - q: "Can I use a VPN on my smart TV or streaming stick?"
    a: "Yes. NordVPN, Surfshark, and ExpressVPN all offer apps for Amazon Fire TV Stick, Android TV, and Google TV. For smart TVs without native VPN support, you can use Smart DNS or install the VPN on your router."
  - q: "How do I fix the Netflix proxy error?"
    a: "Try disconnecting and reconnecting to a different server in the same country, clearing your browser cookies and cache, disabling IPv6, or switching VPN protocols. If nothing works, contact your VPN's support team for a recommended working server."
  - q: "Does a VPN work with live sports streaming?"
    a: "Yes, but not all VPNs work with sports-specific platforms like DAZN and ESPN+. NordVPN is the only VPN on our list that reliably unblocks DAZN in all tested regions. For general sports streaming, NordVPN, Surfshark, and ExpressVPN all work."

Streaming platforms are getting better at detecting VPNs. In 2025, Netflix rolled out advanced VPN-blocking technology that knocked out dozens of providers overnight. Disney+ and BBC iPlayer followed suit. The result: most VPNs simply do not work with major streaming services anymore.

We tested 23 VPN services over the course of six weeks, checking each one against Netflix (US, UK, Japan, and five other libraries), Disney+, BBC iPlayer, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, and DAZN. We retested every provider multiple times to confirm results were consistent rather than one-off flukes.

Here are the VPNs that actually work for streaming in 2026 -- and the ones you should avoid.

## Quick Comparison: Best VPNs for Streaming

| VPN | Streaming Score | Platforms Unblocked | Speed (4K?) | Price | Best For |
|-----|----------------|---------------------|-------------|-------|----------|
| **NordVPN** | 9.7/10 | 15+ platforms | 890 Mbps (Yes) | $3.49/mo | Best overall for streaming |
| **Surfshark** | 9.2/10 | 13+ platforms | 780 Mbps (Yes) | $2.29/mo | Budget streaming VPN |
| **ExpressVPN** | 9.0/10 | 12+ platforms | 880 Mbps (Yes) | $6.67/mo | Most consistent connections |
| **CyberGhost** | 8.5/10 | 10+ platforms | 650 Mbps (Yes) | $2.19/mo | Dedicated streaming servers |
| **Private Internet Access** | 7.8/10 | 8+ platforms | 710 Mbps (Yes) | $2.03/mo | Advanced users |

All five exceed the 25 Mbps threshold required for 4K streaming by a wide margin. But raw speed is only part of the equation -- what matters is whether the VPN can actually bypass the geo-restrictions these platforms enforce.

## 1. NordVPN -- Best VPN for Streaming Overall

<div class="rating">⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ 9.7/10</div>

NordVPN is the most reliable streaming VPN we have ever tested. Throughout six weeks of continuous testing, it unblocked every single platform we threw at it, including notoriously difficult services like Netflix Japan and DAZN.

The secret is NordVPN's massive server infrastructure. With over 6,400 servers across 111 countries, NordVPN rotates IP addresses frequently enough to stay ahead of streaming platform blocklists. When one IP gets flagged, another takes its place almost immediately.

### Streaming Test Results

| Platform | Works? | Libraries Unblocked | Notes |
|----------|--------|---------------------|-------|
| Netflix | Yes | US, UK, JP, CA, AU, DE, FR, IN, KR | All 9 tested libraries worked |
| Disney+ | Yes | US, UK, NL, AU | Instant connection every time |
| BBC iPlayer | Yes | UK | Worked on all 5 UK servers tested |
| Hulu | Yes | US | No issues detected |
| Amazon Prime Video | Yes | US, UK, JP, DE | Consistent across regions |
| DAZN | Yes | US, CA, UK, DE, JP | Rare for a VPN to unblock DAZN globally |
| HBO Max | Yes | US | Reliable access |
| Peacock | Yes | US | Worked every test |

NordVPN achieved a **100% success rate** across all platforms during our testing window. No other VPN matched that.

### Speed Test Results (Streaming-Focused)

We specifically measured speeds during peak streaming hours (7-10 PM local time), because that is when it matters most.

| Server | Download Speed | Enough for 4K? | Buffer Time |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|-------------|
| US (New York) | 720 Mbps | Yes (28x over) | None |
| US (Los Angeles) | 650 Mbps | Yes (26x over) | None |
| UK (London) | 880 Mbps | Yes (35x over) | None |
| Japan (Tokyo) | 580 Mbps | Yes (23x over) | None |
| Australia (Sydney) | 510 Mbps | Yes (20x over) | None |

Even the slowest connection we recorded (510 Mbps to Australia) is over 20 times the speed needed for 4K streaming. Buffering is a non-issue with NordVPN.

### Why NordVPN Is Our #1 for Streaming

- **SmartPlay technology** -- Automatically combines VPN encryption with smart DNS to bypass geo-restrictions without sacrificing speed
- **NordLynx protocol** -- Built on WireGuard, delivers near-native connection speeds
- **Dedicated IP option** -- Available for an extra cost, virtually eliminates VPN detection
- **10 simultaneous connections** -- Cover your smart TV, laptop, phone, and tablet on a single plan

## 2. Surfshark -- Best Budget VPN for Streaming

<div class="rating">⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ 9.2/10</div>

Surfshark proves that you do not need to spend a fortune to get a reliable streaming VPN. At $2.29 per month on the 2-year plan, it costs roughly a third of what ExpressVPN charges -- yet it unblocked 13 of the 15 streaming platforms we tested.

The standout feature for streaming households is **unlimited simultaneous connections**. While NordVPN caps you at 10 devices, Surfshark lets every member of your family connect at the same time on a single subscription. If you have a house full of people streaming on different devices, this is a significant advantage.

### Streaming Test Results

| Platform | Works? | Libraries Unblocked | Notes |
|----------|--------|---------------------|-------|
| Netflix | Yes | US, UK, JP, CA, AU, DE | 6 of 9 tested libraries worked |
| Disney+ | Yes | US, UK, AU | Worked reliably |
| BBC iPlayer | Yes | UK | Required specific UK servers |
| Hulu | Yes | US | Consistent |
| Amazon Prime Video | Yes | US, UK, DE | JP library was hit-or-miss |
| DAZN | Partial | US, CA | Did not work in JP, DE, UK |
| HBO Max | Yes | US | Reliable |
| Peacock | Yes | US | No issues |

Surfshark missed a few of the more restrictive libraries and had partial results with DAZN, but for the platforms most people actually use -- Netflix US/UK, Disney+, Hulu, and BBC iPlayer -- it worked every time.

### Speed Test Results

| Server | Download Speed | Enough for 4K? | Buffer Time |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|-------------|
| US (New York) | 610 Mbps | Yes (24x over) | None |
| US (Los Angeles) | 560 Mbps | Yes (22x over) | None |
| UK (London) | 780 Mbps | Yes (31x over) | None |
| Japan (Tokyo) | 440 Mbps | Yes (17x over) | None |
| Australia (Sydney) | 380 Mbps | Yes (15x over) | None |

Speeds are slightly lower than NordVPN across the board, but every connection still far exceeds what you need for buffer-free 4K streaming.

## 3. ExpressVPN -- Most Consistent Streaming VPN

<div class="rating">⭐⭐⭐⭐½ 9.0/10</div>

ExpressVPN has long been considered the gold standard for streaming, and while NordVPN has overtaken it in our overall rankings, it remains one of the most reliable options available.

What sets ExpressVPN apart is **consistency**. Every time we connected to a streaming-optimized server, it worked on the first attempt. There was never a need to switch servers, clear cookies, or troubleshoot. For users who value a seamless experience over pinching pennies, ExpressVPN delivers.

### Streaming Test Results

| Platform | Works? | Libraries Unblocked | Notes |
|----------|--------|---------------------|-------|
| Netflix | Yes | US, UK, JP, CA, AU | 5 of 9 tested libraries worked |
| Disney+ | Yes | US, UK | Instant connection |
| BBC iPlayer | Yes | UK | First-attempt success every time |
| Hulu | Yes | US | No issues |
| Amazon Prime Video | Yes | US, UK, JP | Consistent |
| DAZN | Partial | US, CA, UK | Did not work in JP, DE |
| HBO Max | Yes | US | Reliable |
| Peacock | Yes | US | No issues |

### Speed Test Results

| Server | Download Speed | Enough for 4K? | Buffer Time |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|-------------|
| US (New York) | 680 Mbps | Yes (27x over) | None |
| US (Los Angeles) | 640 Mbps | Yes (25x over) | None |
| UK (London) | 860 Mbps | Yes (34x over) | None |
| Japan (Tokyo) | 530 Mbps | Yes (21x over) | None |
| Australia (Sydney) | 470 Mbps | Yes (18x over) | None |

ExpressVPN uses its proprietary **Lightway protocol**, which is comparable to NordLynx in performance. The speeds are excellent and more than sufficient for 4K HDR streaming on every server we tested.

<div class="pros-cons">
<div class="pros">
<strong>Pros</strong>

- Extremely consistent -- works on the first attempt
- Lightway protocol delivers excellent speeds
- MediaStreamer feature for devices that do not support VPN apps
- Intuitive, polished apps across all platforms
- 24/7 live chat support is genuinely helpful
- 30-day money-back guarantee
</div>
<div class="cons">
<strong>Cons</strong>

- Significantly more expensive than NordVPN and Surfshark
- Only 8 simultaneous connections
- Fewer Netflix libraries unblocked than NordVPN
- No dedicated streaming servers (all servers are general-purpose)
</div>
</div>

### Pricing

| Plan | Monthly Cost | Total Cost | Savings |
|------|-------------|------------|---------|
| 1-year plan | $6.67/mo | $80.04 | 49% off |
| 6-month plan | $9.99/mo | $59.94 | 24% off |
| Monthly | $12.95/mo | $12.95 | -- |

ExpressVPN is the priciest option on this list. However, if reliability is your top priority and budget is not a concern, it is a premium choice that consistently delivers.

## 4. CyberGhost -- Best for Dedicated Streaming Servers

<div class="rating">⭐⭐⭐⭐ 8.5/10</div>

CyberGhost takes a unique approach by offering **dedicated streaming servers**. Instead of guessing which server might work with Netflix or BBC iPlayer, you simply select a server labeled "Netflix US" or "BBC iPlayer" and connect. This removes the trial-and-error process entirely.

### Streaming Test Results

| Platform | Works? | Libraries Unblocked | Notes |
|----------|--------|---------------------|-------|
| Netflix | Yes | US, UK, DE, FR | 4 of 9 tested libraries worked |
| Disney+ | Yes | US, UK | Reliable with dedicated servers |
| BBC iPlayer | Yes | UK | Dedicated server available |
| Hulu | Yes | US | Dedicated server available |
| Amazon Prime Video | Yes | US, UK | Dedicated server available |
| DAZN | No | -- | Blocked on all servers tested |
| HBO Max | Yes | US | Dedicated server available |
| Peacock | Partial | US | Intermittent success |

CyberGhost struggled with DAZN entirely and had issues with Peacock, but it handled the major platforms well -- particularly when using its labeled streaming servers.

<div class="pros-cons">
<div class="pros">
<strong>Pros</strong>

- Dedicated streaming servers take the guesswork out
- Very affordable ($2.19/mo on 2-year plan)
- 7 simultaneous connections
- 45-day money-back guarantee (longest on this list)
- Beginner-friendly interface
</div>
<div class="cons">
<strong>Cons</strong>

- Cannot unblock DAZN
- Fewer Netflix libraries than NordVPN
- Speeds are lower than the top three
- Some streaming servers get blocked and are slow to update
</div>
</div>

## 5. Private Internet Access (PIA) -- Best for Advanced Users

<div class="rating">⭐⭐⭐⭐ 7.8/10</div>

PIA is not typically marketed as a streaming VPN, but it has improved significantly in this area over the past year. With its open-source apps and extensive customization options, it appeals to technically-minded users who want granular control.

### Streaming Test Results

| Platform | Works? | Libraries Unblocked | Notes |
|----------|--------|---------------------|-------|
| Netflix | Yes | US, UK, JP | 3 of 9 tested libraries worked |
| Disney+ | Yes | US | Only US library tested successfully |
| BBC iPlayer | Partial | UK | Worked on some servers, not others |
| Hulu | Yes | US | Consistent |
| Amazon Prime Video | Yes | US, UK | Required manual server selection |
| DAZN | No | -- | Blocked |

<div class="pros-cons">
<div class="pros">
<strong>Pros</strong>

- Very affordable ($2.03/mo on 3-year plan)
- Open-source apps
- Unlimited simultaneous connections
- Strong privacy credentials
- Highly customizable
</div>
<div class="cons">
<strong>Cons</strong>

- Streaming is not its primary strength
- BBC iPlayer support is unreliable
- Cannot unblock DAZN
- Requires more manual configuration for streaming
</div>

## Platform-by-Platform Guide: Which VPN Works Where?

Not every VPN works with every streaming service. Here is a detailed breakdown based on our testing in February 2026.

### Netflix

Netflix has the most aggressive VPN detection of any streaming platform. It blocks residential VPN IPs, data center IPs, and even some dedicated IPs.

**Best VPN for Netflix: NordVPN** -- Unblocked 9 out of 9 Netflix libraries we tested. SmartPlay DNS technology keeps connections working even as Netflix updates its blocklists.

| VPN | US | UK | JP | CA | AU | DE | FR | IN | KR |
|-----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|-----|
| NordVPN | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Surfshark | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| ExpressVPN | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | No | No |
| CyberGhost | Yes | Yes | No | No | No | Yes | Yes | No | No |
| PIA | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | No | No | No | No |

### Disney+

Disney+ launched updated VPN detection in late 2025, which made it harder for budget VPNs to maintain access. All three of our top picks still work.

**Best VPN for Disney+: NordVPN** -- Works with US, UK, Netherlands, and Australian Disney+ libraries.

| VPN | US | UK | NL | AU |
|-----|----|----|----|----|
| NordVPN | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Surfshark | Yes | Yes | No | Yes |
| ExpressVPN | Yes | Yes | No | No |
| CyberGhost | Yes | Yes | No | No |

### BBC iPlayer

BBC iPlayer is free for UK residents but completely geo-blocked outside the UK. It uses sophisticated detection that blocks most VPNs.

**Best VPN for BBC iPlayer: NordVPN** -- Every UK server we tested worked with iPlayer. Surfshark also works, but you may need to try multiple servers.

| VPN | UK |
|-----|-----|
| NordVPN | Yes (all servers) |
| Surfshark | Yes (select servers) |
| ExpressVPN | Yes (all servers) |
| CyberGhost | Yes (dedicated server) |
| PIA | Partial |

### Hulu

Hulu is US-only and uses geo-blocking to enforce this restriction. The good news is that all five VPNs on our list successfully unblock Hulu.

**Best VPN for Hulu: NordVPN** -- Reliable, fast, and never required a server switch.

### Amazon Prime Video

Amazon Prime Video has different content libraries in each country. A VPN lets you access content available in other regions.

**Best VPN for Amazon Prime Video: NordVPN** -- Unblocked US, UK, Japan, and German libraries. Surfshark and ExpressVPN also performed well here.

### DAZN

DAZN is the most difficult streaming platform to unblock with a VPN. Its detection system is extremely aggressive, and most VPNs fail entirely.

**Best VPN for DAZN: NordVPN** -- The only VPN that unblocked DAZN in all five regions we tested (US, Canada, UK, Germany, Japan). This alone makes NordVPN worth considering if DAZN is important to you.

| VPN | US | CA | UK | DE | JP |
|-----|----|----|----|----|-----|
| NordVPN | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Surfshark | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| ExpressVPN | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No |
| CyberGhost | No | No | No | No | No |
| PIA | No | No | No | No | No |

## Speed Tests: Can These VPNs Handle 4K Streaming?

For 4K Ultra HD streaming, you need a minimum of **25 Mbps**. For 4K HDR content (Dolby Vision, HDR10), Netflix recommends **at least 25 Mbps** while Disney+ recommends **25 Mbps**. Standard HD (1080p) requires about 5 Mbps.

We tested all five VPNs during peak evening hours (7:00 PM to 10:00 PM) from a 1 Gbps fiber connection in Amsterdam, connecting to US East Coast servers, which is one of the most common streaming use cases for European users.

### Peak-Hour Speed Comparison (US East Coast Server)

| VPN | Download | Upload | Latency | 4K Capable? | Speed Retained |
|-----|----------|--------|---------|-------------|----------------|
| **NordVPN** | 720 Mbps | 340 Mbps | 85 ms | Yes | 72% |
| **ExpressVPN** | 680 Mbps | 310 Mbps | 88 ms | Yes | 68% |
| **Surfshark** | 610 Mbps | 280 Mbps | 92 ms | Yes | 61% |
| **PIA** | 590 Mbps | 260 Mbps | 95 ms | Yes | 59% |
| **CyberGhost** | 520 Mbps | 230 Mbps | 102 ms | Yes | 52% |

### What This Means in Practice

Even CyberGhost at 520 Mbps is over **20 times** the speed needed for 4K streaming. In real-world use, none of these VPNs will cause buffering on any streaming platform. The speed differences become relevant only if you are simultaneously streaming on multiple devices, downloading large files, or gaming.

NordVPN's NordLynx protocol and ExpressVPN's Lightway protocol are the fastest, consistently retaining 68-72% of the base connection speed even on transatlantic connections.

## How to Use a VPN for Streaming (Step-by-Step)

If you have never used a VPN for streaming before, here is a straightforward guide.

### Step 1: Choose and Subscribe to a VPN

We recommend starting with NordVPN for the best streaming experience. All three of our top picks offer 30-day money-back guarantees, so you can test them risk-free.

<a href="https://go.nordvpn.net/aff_c?offer_id=612&aff_id=141337&url_id=14830" class="cta" rel="nofollow sponsored" target="_blank">Start NordVPN Free Trial -- 30-Day Money Back</a>

### Step 2: Download and Install the App

Download the VPN app for your device. All three top-rated VPNs support:
- Windows, macOS, Linux
- iOS, Android
- Amazon Fire TV Stick
- Android TV, Google TV
- Smart TVs (Samsung, LG via Smart DNS)
- Routers (for devices that do not support VPN apps natively)

### Step 3: Connect to a Server in the Right Country

Open the VPN app and connect to a server in the country whose content library you want to access. For example:
- **Netflix US** -- Connect to a US server
- **BBC iPlayer** -- Connect to a UK server
- **DAZN Japan** -- Connect to a Japanese server

### Step 4: Clear Your Browser Cache and Cookies

Streaming platforms often use cached location data. Before opening the streaming app or website:
1. Clear your browser cookies and cache
2. If using a streaming app, force-close and reopen it
3. On some devices, you may need to sign out and sign back in

### Step 5: Open the Streaming Platform and Start Watching

Navigate to the streaming service as you normally would. The content library should now reflect the country you connected to. If you see an error or the wrong library, try switching to a different server in the same country.

### Troubleshooting Tips

- **Still seeing your local library?** Clear cookies, restart the app, or try a different server
- **Getting a proxy error?** Switch servers. Some IPs get flagged faster than others
- **Slow loading or buffering?** Connect to a closer server or switch protocols (NordLynx/Lightway are fastest)
- **Smart TV not working?** Use Smart DNS instead of the full VPN app, or set up the VPN on your router

## Pricing Comparison

Here is how the five recommended streaming VPNs compare on price.

| VPN | Monthly | 1-Year Plan | Best Deal | Money-Back Guarantee | Devices |
|-----|---------|-------------|-----------|---------------------|---------|
| **NordVPN** | $12.99/mo | $4.99/mo | $3.49/mo (2-year) | 30 days | 10 |
| **Surfshark** | $15.45/mo | $3.99/mo | $2.29/mo (2-year) | 30 days | Unlimited |
| **ExpressVPN** | $12.95/mo | $6.67/mo | $6.67/mo (1-year) | 30 days | 8 |
| **CyberGhost** | $12.99/mo | $4.29/mo | $2.19/mo (2-year) | 45 days | 7 |
| **PIA** | $11.95/mo | $3.33/mo | $2.03/mo (3-year) | 30 days | Unlimited |

### Which Plan Offers the Best Value for Streaming?

**NordVPN's 2-year plan at $3.49/month** is our recommendation for most users. It strikes the best balance between price, streaming performance, and features. You get 10 device connections, which is enough for most households, plus the widest streaming platform support of any VPN we tested.

**Surfshark at $2.29/month** is the best choice if you have a large household. Unlimited connections mean everyone can stream simultaneously without issues.

**ExpressVPN at $6.67/month** is a premium option for users who prioritize simplicity and reliability above all else.

## VPNs We Tested That Did NOT Work for Streaming

Not every VPN is up to the task. The following providers failed to consistently unblock major streaming platforms during our testing:

- **TunnelBear** -- Blocked by Netflix, Disney+, and BBC iPlayer on nearly every attempt
- **Windscribe (free plan)** -- Could not access any geo-restricted streaming service
- **HideMyAss** -- Unblocked Netflix US intermittently, failed on all other platforms
- **IPVanish** -- Netflix blocked most servers; BBC iPlayer did not work at all
- **AtlasVPN** -- Inconsistent results across every platform tested

If streaming is your primary use case, stick with the top three: NordVPN, Surfshark, or ExpressVPN.

## FAQ: VPN Streaming Questions Answered

### Is it legal to use a VPN for streaming?

Using a VPN is legal in most countries, including the US, UK, Canada, Australia, and across the EU. However, using a VPN to circumvent geo-restrictions may violate the terms of service of streaming platforms. In practice, the worst that typically happens is the streaming service blocks your VPN connection -- accounts are not banned for using VPNs. That said, always check the laws in your specific country, as a handful of nations restrict or ban VPN use outright.

### Will a VPN slow down my streaming?

A VPN adds a small amount of overhead because your traffic is encrypted and routed through an additional server. However, with a high-quality VPN like NordVPN, Surfshark, or ExpressVPN, the speed reduction is minimal. In our tests, the top VPNs retained 60-72% of the base connection speed even on long-distance connections, which is far more than the 25 Mbps needed for 4K streaming. You should not experience any buffering or quality reduction with any of our recommended VPNs.

### Why does Netflix block VPNs?

Netflix licenses content on a country-by-country basis. A movie available on Netflix US may not be licensed for Netflix UK. Content owners contractually require Netflix to enforce geo-restrictions, so Netflix actively detects and blocks VPN connections to comply with these licensing agreements. The VPNs that still work are the ones investing heavily in rotating IPs and advanced obfuscation techniques.

### Can I use a free VPN for streaming?

We do not recommend free VPNs for streaming. Free VPNs typically have limited server locations, data caps (often 500 MB to 2 GB per month -- not nearly enough for streaming), slower speeds, and poor success rates with geo-blocked content. More importantly, many free VPNs monetize by logging and selling your browsing data. A budget option like Surfshark at $2.29/month is a far better choice.

### Which VPN is best for Netflix specifically?

NordVPN is the best VPN for Netflix in 2026. It unblocked all 9 Netflix libraries we tested, including notoriously difficult ones like Japan and South Korea. Its SmartPlay technology is specifically designed to bypass Netflix's VPN detection. Read our [full NordVPN review](/posts/nordvpn-review-2026/) for more details.

### Will my streaming account get banned for using a VPN?

No. Streaming platforms do not ban accounts for VPN usage. When a VPN is detected, the platform simply blocks access to content until you disconnect or switch to a non-VPN connection. Your account remains in good standing. We have used VPNs with Netflix, Disney+, and other platforms for years without a single account issue.

### Can I use a VPN on my smart TV or streaming stick?

Yes. NordVPN, Surfshark, and ExpressVPN all offer apps for Amazon Fire TV Stick, Android TV, and Google TV. For smart TVs that do not support VPN apps natively (like most Samsung and LG TVs), you can use Smart DNS (available with all three top VPNs) or install the VPN on your router to cover all connected devices.

### How do I fix the Netflix proxy error?

If you see "You seem to be using an unblocker or proxy" on Netflix, try these steps:

1. Disconnect from the VPN and reconnect to a different server in the same country
2. Clear your browser cookies and cache
3. Disable IPv6 in your device settings (IPv6 leaks can reveal your location)
4. Switch VPN protocols (try NordLynx or Lightway)
5. If none of the above works, contact your VPN's support team -- they can usually recommend a working server

### Does a VPN work with live sports streaming?

Yes, but not all VPNs work with sports-specific platforms like DAZN and ESPN+. NordVPN is the only VPN on our list that reliably unblocks DAZN in all tested regions. For general sports streaming through platforms like Hulu + Live TV or YouTube TV, NordVPN, Surfshark, and ExpressVPN all work.

## Our Testing Methodology

We believe in transparency about how we test VPNs for streaming. Here is our process:

1. **Subscription** -- We purchase every VPN with our own money. We do not accept free accounts from providers.
2. **Testing period** -- Each VPN was tested over 6 weeks (January to mid-February 2026).
3. **Test frequency** -- Each platform was tested at least 3 times per week, per VPN, to account for day-to-day variability.
4. **Peak-hour testing** -- Speed tests were conducted during peak streaming hours (7-10 PM local time).
5. **Multiple devices** -- We tested on Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, and Amazon Fire TV Stick.
6. **Clean environment** -- Each test started with cleared cookies and a fresh browser profile.
7. **Multiple servers** -- For each platform, we tested at least 5 different servers in the target country.

We are transparent about our affiliate relationships: we earn a commission when you purchase a VPN through our links. However, our testing methodology and rankings are independent. NordVPN earns the top spot because it performed the best in our tests, not because of commission rates.
