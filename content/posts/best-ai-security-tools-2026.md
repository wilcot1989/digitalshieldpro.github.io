## AI in Cybersecurity: What You Need to Know

### How AI Improves Security

1. **Pattern recognition** — AI can analyze millions of data points to identify threats that humans would miss
2. **Speed** — AI responds to threats in milliseconds, not hours
3. **Prediction** — Machine learning models can predict new attack vectors before they're exploited
4. **Automation** — Routine security tasks are handled automatically

### The Dark Side: AI-Powered Attacks

It's important to note that attackers are also using AI:
- **AI-generated phishing emails** — Nearly indistinguishable from legitimate emails
- **Deepfake voice calls** — AI cloning voices for social engineering
- **Automated vulnerability scanning** — AI finds and exploits weaknesses faster

This is exactly why you need AI-powered defense tools — you're fighting AI with AI.

## Our Recommendation

For most people, we recommend a **layered approach**:

1. **Bitdefender or Norton** as your primary antivirus (AI threat detection)
2. **1Password or Bitwarden** for password management
3. **A VPN like NordVPN** for network privacy
4. **Malwarebytes** as a secondary scanner

This combination covers 99% of threats the average person faces online.
