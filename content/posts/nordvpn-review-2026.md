faq:
  - q: "Is NordVPN safe?"

  - q: "Does NordVPN work with Netflix?"
    a: "Yes. NordVPN consistently unblocks Netflix in the US, UK, Japan, and 15+ other regions. Their SmartPlay technology makes it seamless -- just connect to a server and start streaming."
  - q: "Is NordVPN worth the price?"
    a: "At $3.49/month on the 2-year plan, NordVPN offers exceptional value with the fastest speeds, most reliable streaming access, and the most thoroughly audited privacy policy in the industry."

  - q: "Does NordVPN slow down internet?"
    a: "Minimally. In our tests, NordVPN retained 94% of base speed on nearby servers. You will barely notice the difference for browsing, streaming, or gaming."
  - q: "How many devices can I use with NordVPN?"
    a: "NordVPN allows 10 simultaneous connections per account. You can also install it on your router to protect all devices on your network without using a device slot."

I have been running NordVPN as my daily driver for six months -- on my work laptop, homelab desktop, phone, and even a router feeding my entire network. After testing dozens of VPNs over the years, I wanted to see if NordVPN genuinely deserves the top spot or if it is just riding a massive marketing budget. Here is my honest verdict after half a year of daily use.

**Bottom line:** NordVPN earns its reputation. It's fast, secure, and works with virtually every streaming platform. It's our #1 pick for most users.

<div class="rating">⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ 9.5/10</div>

## Speed Test Results

Speed is where NordVPN truly shines. Their proprietary **NordLynx protocol** (built on WireGuard) delivers speeds that come remarkably close to your base connection speed.

### Our Test Setup
- Base connection: 1 Gbps fiber (Amsterdam, Netherlands)
- Testing tool: Speedtest by Ookla, repeated 3 times per server
- Testing period: January-February 2026

### Results by Region

| Server Location | Download | Upload | Latency | Speed Retention |
|----------------|----------|--------|---------|-----------------|
| **Netherlands** (local) | 940 Mbps | 450 Mbps | 3 ms | 94% |
| **Germany** (nearby) | 910 Mbps | 430 Mbps | 8 ms | 91% |
| **United Kingdom** | 880 Mbps | 410 Mbps | 12 ms | 88% |
| **United States (East)** | 720 Mbps | 340 Mbps | 85 ms | 72% |
| **United States (West)** | 650 Mbps | 290 Mbps | 140 ms | 65% |
| **Japan** | 580 Mbps | 250 Mbps | 230 ms | 58% |
| **Australia** | 510 Mbps | 210 Mbps | 280 ms | 51% |

### Speed Verdict

NordVPN retained over 90% of our connection speed on European servers — that's exceptional. Even connecting to the US (a common use case for streaming), we saw 650-720 Mbps, which is more than enough for 4K streaming, gaming, and large downloads.

**Compared to competitors:**
- NordVPN: 940 Mbps (local), 720 Mbps (US)
- ExpressVPN: 880 Mbps (local), 680 Mbps (US)
- Surfshark: 780 Mbps (local), 590 Mbps (US)

NordVPN is consistently the fastest VPN I've tested.

## Security & Privacy

### Encryption
NordVPN uses **AES-256-GCM** encryption — the same standard used by governments and military organizations. Through NordLynx, it uses ChaCha20 for the data channel, which is equally secure but faster on mobile devices.

### No-Logs Policy
NordVPN's no-logs policy has been **independently audited three times** — twice by PricewaterhouseCoopers and once by Deloitte. The audits confirmed that NordVPN does not store:
- Connection timestamps
- Session duration
- IP addresses
- Browsing data
- Bandwidth usage

### Panama Jurisdiction
NordVPN is incorporated in Panama, which has **no mandatory data retention laws** and is outside the 5/9/14 Eyes intelligence sharing alliances. This means even if a government requested your data, NordVPN has nothing to hand over.

### Security Features

**Threat Protection Pro** — More than just a VPN, this feature:
- Blocks malicious websites before they load
- Scans downloaded files for malware
- Blocks trackers and intrusive ads
- Works even when the VPN is disconnected

**Double VPN** — Routes your traffic through two separate VPN servers in different countries. This means even if one server were compromised, your traffic remains encrypted. Ideal for journalists, activists, or anyone needing maximum privacy.

**Onion Over VPN** — Combines NordVPN with the Tor network for extreme anonymity. Your traffic goes through a VPN server first, then enters the Tor network, making it virtually impossible to trace.

**Kill Switch** — Two levels available:
1. **App Kill Switch** — Closes specific apps if the VPN drops
2. **Internet Kill Switch** — Blocks all internet access if the VPN disconnects

### DNS & IP Leak Tests

I tested NordVPN for leaks using ipleak.net, dnsleaktest.com, and browserleaks.com:

| Test | Result |
|------|--------|
| DNS leak | No leaks detected |
| WebRTC leak | No leaks detected |
| IPv6 leak | No leaks detected (IPv6 disabled) |
| IP address | Correctly shows VPN server IP |

**Security Verdict:** 10/10. NordVPN's security infrastructure is among the best in the industry. The triple audit of their no-logs policy, Panama jurisdiction, and comprehensive leak protection make it a top choice for privacy-focused users.

## Streaming Performance

This is where many VPNs fall short. Streaming platforms actively try to block VPN connections, and most VPNs can't keep up. NordVPN has dedicated teams that maintain access to major platforms.

### Streaming Test Results (February 2026)

| Platform | US | UK | Netherlands | Japan | Result |
|----------|:--:|:--:|:-----------:|:-----:|--------|
| Netflix | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | All libraries accessible |
| Disney+ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | No issues |
| Amazon Prime | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | N/A | Reliable |
| BBC iPlayer | N/A | ✅ | N/A | N/A | Works perfectly |
| Hulu | ✅ | N/A | N/A | N/A | US-only, works |
| HBO Max | ✅ | N/A | N/A | N/A | Works |
| DAZN | ✅ | ✅ | N/A | ✅ | Works on most servers |
| YouTube Premium | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | No restrictions |

### SmartPlay Technology

NordVPN's **SmartPlay** technology combines Smart DNS with VPN security. It automatically activates when you connect to a streaming service, ensuring:
- No manual DNS configuration needed
- Consistent access across all NordVPN servers
- Full encryption maintained while streaming

### Streaming Verdict

NordVPN unblocked **every streaming platform** I tested. In my experience, it's tied with ExpressVPN for the most reliable streaming VPN — but NordVPN does it at a significantly lower price.

## Apps & Ease of Use

### Desktop Apps (Windows & macOS)
The desktop apps received a major redesign in late 2025. The interface is clean and intuitive:
- World map with server markers for visual selection
- Quick Connect button that picks the fastest server
- Specialty servers clearly labeled (Double VPN, Onion, P2P)
- Settings are well-organized without being overwhelming

**Minor gripe:** The app can feel slightly cluttered with all the features visible. A "simple mode" for casual users would be welcome.

### Mobile Apps (Android & iOS)
The mobile apps mirror the desktop experience but are better optimized for touch:
- One-tap connect from the widget
- Dark mode support
- Split tunneling on Android (per-app VPN)
- Siri Shortcuts support on iOS

### Browser Extensions (Chrome & Firefox)
Lightweight extensions that proxy only browser traffic:
- Quick server switching
- WebRTC leak protection
- CyberSec ad/malware blocking
- Doesn't require the full desktop app

### Router Support
NordVPN offers one of the best router setups:
- Pre-configured routers from FlashRouters
- Manual setup guides for ASUS, Netgear, TP-Link, and more
- Custom firmware for select routers
- Protect all devices on your network

The **Plus plan** is excellent value if you also need a password manager — [NordPass](/posts/best-password-managers-2026/) is a solid password manager on its own, and bundling it saves money versus separate subscriptions.

## Our Verdict

NordVPN isn't perfect — no VPN is. The app could be simpler, and the 10-device limit might not be enough for very large households. But these are minor complaints.

What NordVPN does, it does better than anyone else: **fast speeds, bulletproof security, and reliable streaming access** — all backed by the most transparent privacy policy in the industry.

If you only get one cybersecurity tool this year, make it NordVPN.
