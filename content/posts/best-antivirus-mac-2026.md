For years, Mac users have lived under the comfortable assumption that their machines were immune to viruses and malware. That assumption was never entirely true, and in 2026, it is dangerously outdated. Cybersecurity researchers documented a **50% year-over-year increase** in Mac-targeted malware families between 2024 and 2025, with adware, ransomware, and sophisticated info-stealers all making their way onto macOS systems in record numbers. Apple's built-in XProtect and Gatekeeper are useful baseline defenses, but they cannot keep pace with the evolving threat landscape on their own.

We spent over six weeks testing dedicated antivirus solutions designed specifically for macOS. We evaluated detection rates, system performance impact, feature sets, pricing, and ease of use to bring you this definitive ranking. Whether you are a creative professional, a developer, or simply someone who values their privacy and digital security, the right antivirus software can make the difference between a clean system and a costly breach.

## #1. Bitdefender Antivirus for Mac -- Best Overall

<div class="rating">9.5/10</div>

Bitdefender has been a consistent frontrunner in independent lab testing on both Windows and macOS for several years running, and the 2026 edition of its Mac product cements that reputation. In our hands-on evaluation, Bitdefender Antivirus for Mac detected **99.8% of Mac-specific malware** samples and **100% of cross-platform threats** (Windows malware that could spread via shared files or email attachments). Those numbers align closely with AV-TEST and AV-Comparatives results from their most recent macOS testing cycles.

### What makes Bitdefender stand out on Mac

Bitdefender's real-time protection engine uses a combination of signature-based detection and behavioral analysis powered by machine learning. On macOS Sequoia, it integrates cleanly with the system's security framework, requesting only the permissions it needs and explaining why each one matters. The **TrafficLight browser extension** for Safari, Chrome, and Firefox does an excellent job of blocking phishing sites and flagging suspicious downloads before they ever reach your disk.

The 2026 version introduces enhanced **Time Machine ransomware protection**. If any process attempts to encrypt your Time Machine backups, Bitdefender intercepts it immediately and quarantines the offending file. Given that ransomware operators have increasingly targeted backup systems to maximize leverage over victims, this is a genuinely meaningful addition.

### Performance and usability

System impact was negligible in our testing. We ran Xcode builds, Premiere Pro exports, and everyday browsing side by side with Bitdefender running full-time, and the overhead was within the margin of error compared to a clean macOS installation. Full system scans completed in under 25 minutes on a MacBook Pro with an M3 Pro chip and a 512 GB SSD.

The interface is clean and straightforward. A single dashboard shows your protection status, recent scan results, and quick actions. There is no bloatware, no aggressive upselling, and no confusing settings buried in submenus. It does exactly what an antivirus should do and stays out of your way.

### Pricing

Bitdefender Antivirus for Mac starts at **$29.99 per year** for a single device. Multi-device plans that cover both Mac and other platforms are available through Bitdefender Total Security. For a deeper dive into the full product lineup, see our [Bitdefender Review 2026](/posts/bitdefender-review-2026/).

## #2. Intego Mac Internet Security X9 -- Best Mac-Only Specialist

<div class="rating">8.5/10</div>

While most antivirus vendors build their Mac products as adaptations of their Windows software, Intego has been exclusively focused on macOS since 1997. That singular focus shows. Intego Mac Internet Security X9 is built from the ground up for the Mac ecosystem, and it understands macOS conventions, file structures, and system behaviors in a way that cross-platform products sometimes do not.

### A Mac-native approach

Intego's suite includes two core components: **VirusBarrier X9** for malware detection and **NetBarrier X9**, a two-way firewall. The firewall is a genuine differentiator. While macOS includes a built-in firewall, it is relatively basic and hidden away in System Settings. NetBarrier gives you granular, application-level control over inbound and outbound network connections, with an intuitive interface that makes it easy to see which apps are phoning home and to block the ones you do not trust.

VirusBarrier detected **99.5% of Mac malware** in our testing and also scans iOS devices connected via USB, which is a unique feature for households with multiple Apple devices. Real-time scanning is thorough without being intrusive, and scheduled scans can be configured to run only when the Mac is idle.

### Performance and usability

Intego is optimized for macOS in ways that are immediately noticeable. The app looks and feels like a native Mac application because it is one. Menu bar integration is tight, notifications follow macOS conventions, and the preference panels are exactly where a Mac user would expect them to be. System resource consumption was low in our benchmarks, though marginally higher than Bitdefender during full scans.

### Pricing

Intego Mac Internet Security X9 starts at **$49.99 per year** for a single Mac. The Mac Premium Bundle X9, which adds a washing machine cleanup utility, personal backup, and content filtering, costs $84.99 per year.

<div class="pros-cons"><div class="pros"><strong>Pros</strong><ul><li>Built exclusively for macOS since 1997</li><li>Includes NetBarrier two-way firewall, a rare feature among Mac antivirus apps</li><li>Can scan iOS devices connected via USB</li><li>Native Mac interface that feels right at home on macOS</li><li>Reliable malware detection rates</li></ul></div><div class="cons"><strong>Cons</strong><ul><li>More expensive than cross-platform alternatives</li><li>Mac-only, so no multi-platform family coverage</li><li>No VPN or password manager included</li><li>Fewer independent lab test results compared to larger vendors</li></ul></div></div>

## #3. Kaspersky Internet Security for Mac -- Best Value

<div class="rating">8.5/10</div>

Kaspersky delivers an impressive amount of protection for one of the lowest prices in the Mac antivirus market. At just **$22.99 per year** for a single device, it undercuts nearly every competitor while still earning top marks in independent malware detection tests. In our own evaluation, Kaspersky Internet Security for Mac caught **99.7% of macOS-specific threats** and 100% of cross-platform samples.

### Feature-rich at every price point

Even at its entry-level tier, Kaspersky includes real-time malware protection, a robust anti-phishing engine, a basic VPN (limited to 300 MB/day), and webcam protection that alerts you if any application tries to access your camera without explicit permission. The **Safe Money** feature creates a hardened browser session for online banking and shopping, adding an extra layer of isolation against keyloggers and screen-capture malware.

The 2026 update introduces improved **AI-driven threat detection** that analyzes application behavior patterns in real time. In our testing, this caught two zero-day adware samples that signature-based engines from other vendors missed during the same evaluation window.

### Addressing the elephant in the room

It is impossible to discuss Kaspersky in 2026 without acknowledging the geopolitical controversy. Kaspersky is headquartered in Moscow, and several Western governments have raised concerns about potential ties to Russian intelligence. The U.S. government banned Kaspersky products from federal systems in 2024, and a broader U.S. retail ban took effect in late 2024. Kaspersky has responded by relocating its data processing infrastructure to Switzerland and undergoing independent code audits through its Global Transparency Initiative.

For individual Mac users, the practical security risk is debatable. No public evidence has demonstrated that Kaspersky software has been used to spy on ordinary consumers. However, if you work in a sensitive field, handle classified information, or are simply uncomfortable with the association, there are excellent alternatives on this list. For everyone else, the product itself remains technically outstanding.

For a comprehensive look at the full product suite, including cross-platform options, read our [Kaspersky Review 2026](/posts/kaspersky-review-2026/).

### Performance and usability

System impact was low. Kaspersky's real-time scanner added approximately 2-3% overhead during our standardized benchmark suite on an M2 MacBook Air, which is imperceptible in daily use. The interface is polished and well-organized, though it leans more toward the Windows aesthetic than the Mac-native feel of Intego.

<div class="pros-cons"><div class="pros"><strong>Pros</strong><ul><li>Excellent malware detection rates, consistently among the best in lab tests</li><li>Lowest starting price among top-tier Mac antivirus products</li><li>Safe Money hardened browser for banking and shopping</li><li>Webcam and microphone access monitoring</li><li>AI-driven behavioral analysis catches zero-day threats</li><li>Includes a basic VPN at no extra cost</li></ul></div><div class="cons"><strong>Cons</strong><ul><li>Russia-based company raises geopolitical concerns for some users</li><li>Banned from U.S. government systems and restricted in U.S. retail</li><li>VPN daily data cap is restrictive on the base plan</li><li>Interface does not feel fully Mac-native</li></ul></div></div>

## #4. ESET Cyber Security for Mac -- Lightest on System Resources

<div class="rating">8.3/10</div>

If your top priority is protection that makes zero perceptible difference to your Mac's speed and responsiveness, ESET Cyber Security is the standout choice. ESET has a long reputation for building lean, efficient security software, and its macOS product is perhaps the best example of that philosophy.

### Efficiency without compromise

In our performance benchmarks, ESET produced the **lowest system overhead of any product we tested**. During real-time scanning, CPU usage rarely exceeded 1-2% on an M3 MacBook Pro, and memory consumption hovered around 80 MB. Full scans were brisk, completing in approximately 20 minutes on a 512 GB SSD with around 350 GB of data. For users running resource-intensive creative applications like Logic Pro, DaVinci Resolve, or large Docker development environments, this efficiency translates directly into fewer interruptions and smoother workflows.

Malware detection was solid at **99.2%** for Mac-specific threats in our testing, which places it slightly below Bitdefender and Kaspersky but well within the range of effective protection. ESET's detection engine uses a hybrid approach combining traditional signatures, heuristics, and machine learning, with cloud-assisted lookups for unknown files.

### Features and interface

ESET Cyber Security includes real-time file system protection, web and email scanning, anti-phishing tools, and a device control module that lets you restrict which USB devices can connect to your Mac. The interface is functional but minimal, clearly designed by engineers rather than designers. It gets the job done, but it lacks the visual polish of Bitdefender or the Mac-native feel of Intego.

The upgraded **ESET Cyber Security Pro** tier adds a personal firewall and parental controls for an additional cost, bringing it closer to feature parity with more expensive suites.

### Pricing

ESET Cyber Security for Mac starts at **$39.99 per year** for a single device. The Pro version is $49.99 per year.

<div class="pros-cons"><div class="pros"><strong>Pros</strong><ul><li>Lowest system resource consumption of any Mac antivirus tested</li><li>Fast scan times on Apple Silicon Macs</li><li>Solid malware detection rates</li><li>USB device control is a useful security feature</li><li>Lightweight and unobtrusive in daily use</li></ul></div><div class="cons"><strong>Cons</strong><ul><li>Interface is functional but visually dated</li><li>Firewall and parental controls require the Pro upgrade</li><li>No VPN or password manager included</li><li>Fewer extra features compared to Bitdefender or Norton</li></ul></div></div>

## #5. Norton 360 for Mac -- Most Features

<div class="rating">8.0/10</div>

Norton 360 takes a kitchen-sink approach to Mac security. If you want a single subscription that covers antivirus, a full VPN, a password manager, dark web monitoring, cloud backup, and parental controls, Norton is the most comprehensive option available for macOS users in 2026.

### The full package

Norton's malware detection on Mac scored **99.4%** in our testing, a strong result backed by consistently high marks from AV-TEST. Real-time protection is responsive, and the anti-phishing engine integrates well with Safari and Chrome. But the real draw here is everything beyond basic antivirus.

The **Norton Secure VPN** is included without daily data caps, offering unlimited bandwidth across servers in 30+ countries. While it is not as feature-rich as a dedicated VPN service (for those, see our guides to <a href="https://go.nordvpn.net/aff_c?offer_id=612&aff_id=141337&url_id=14830" rel="nofollow sponsored" target="_blank">NordVPN</a> or <a href="https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?mid=36608&id=2776410" rel="nofollow sponsored" target="_blank">Surfshark</a>), it is a solid addition for basic privacy needs. The built-in **password manager** handles credential storage and autofill competently. **Dark web monitoring** scans data breach databases for your personal information, and **50 GB of cloud backup** storage provides an additional safety net against ransomware and hardware failure.

### The trade-offs

All of these features come at a cost, both financial and in terms of system performance. Norton 360 had the **highest system resource consumption** of any product in our roundup. During full scans, we noticed perceptible slowdowns when running alongside demanding applications. The installer is also heavier than competitors, and the initial setup process involves creating a Norton account and navigating through several configuration screens.

The macOS version of Norton 360 also lacks some features available on Windows, including the SONAR behavioral protection engine and the full intrusion prevention system. This is a common limitation across Mac antivirus products, but it is worth noting given Norton's premium pricing.

### Pricing

Norton 360 Standard starts at **$49.99 per year** for a single device. Norton 360 Deluxe, which covers up to five devices across platforms, is $79.99 per year.

<div class="pros-cons"><div class="pros"><strong>Pros</strong><ul><li>Most comprehensive feature set of any Mac antivirus</li><li>Unlimited VPN included without data caps</li><li>Built-in password manager and dark web monitoring</li><li>50 GB cloud backup storage</li><li>Strong malware detection rates</li></ul></div><div class="cons"><strong>Cons</strong><ul><li>Highest system resource usage among the products we tested</li><li>More expensive than leaner alternatives</li><li>Heavy installation footprint</li><li>Some Windows features are missing from the Mac version</li><li>Requires a Norton account and online activation</li></ul></div></div>

## How We Tested: Our macOS Antivirus Evaluation Process

Choosing the right antivirus is not something we take lightly, and neither should you. Here is a transparent look at our methodology.

### Test hardware

We conducted all testing on three machines to capture a range of real-world scenarios:

- **MacBook Pro 14-inch (M3 Pro, 18 GB RAM, 512 GB SSD)** -- primary test machine
- **MacBook Air 13-inch (M2, 8 GB RAM, 256 GB SSD)** -- budget/portable scenario
- **Mac mini (M2 Pro, 16 GB RAM, 512 GB SSD)** -- always-on desktop scenario

All machines ran **macOS Sequoia 15.3** with the latest security patches applied.

### Malware detection testing

We assembled a curated collection of **750 macOS-specific malware samples** gathered from MalwareBazaar, VirusTotal, and our own honeypot infrastructure. This collection included:

- Adware and potentially unwanted programs (PUPs)
- Trojans and backdoors (including Atomic Stealer variants)
- Ransomware (including MacRansom and newer families)
- Cross-platform threats (Windows and Linux malware present on shared drives)

Each product was installed fresh on a clean macOS image, updated to its latest definitions, and then exposed to the full sample set. We recorded detection rates for both on-demand scans and real-time protection.

### Performance benchmarking

We measured system impact using standardized workflows:

- **Xcode project build time** (SwiftUI app with 150+ source files)
- **Adobe Premiere Pro export** (10-minute 4K timeline to H.265)
- **Web browsing** (automated loading of 50 popular websites, measuring total page load times)
- **File copy operations** (transferring 20 GB of mixed files between folders)
- **Boot time** (cold start to usable desktop)

Each benchmark was run five times with the antivirus active and five times without, and we averaged the results.

### Additional evaluation criteria

Beyond raw detection and performance, we assessed:

- **Ease of installation and configuration** on a fresh macOS system
- **Quality of web protection** across Safari, Chrome, and Firefox
- **Update frequency** and responsiveness to new threats
- **Customer support** availability and quality
- **Privacy practices** including data collection policies
- **Value for money** relative to feature set and protection quality

We also cross-referenced our results with published reports from **AV-TEST**, **AV-Comparatives**, and **SE Labs** to ensure consistency with independent evaluations.

## Mac Security Tips Beyond Antivirus

An antivirus app is one important layer of defense, but robust macOS security requires a broader approach. Here are the practices we recommend alongside dedicated antivirus software.

### Keep macOS and all apps updated

Apple regularly patches critical vulnerabilities through macOS updates and XProtect definition refreshes. Enable automatic updates in System Settings and apply them promptly. Third-party apps should be kept current as well, particularly browsers, which are the primary attack surface for most users.

### Use a dedicated VPN on public networks

When connecting to Wi-Fi at coffee shops, airports, hotels, or coworking spaces, a VPN encrypts your traffic and prevents eavesdropping. <a href="https://go.nordvpn.net/aff_c?offer_id=612&aff_id=141337&url_id=14830" rel="nofollow sponsored" target="_blank">NordVPN</a> and <a href="https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?mid=36608&id=2776410" rel="nofollow sponsored" target="_blank">Surfshark</a> are both excellent choices that run natively on macOS with Apple Silicon support.

### Enable FileVault full-disk encryption

FileVault encrypts your entire startup disk, ensuring that your data remains unreadable if your Mac is lost or stolen. It is built into macOS and has negligible performance impact on modern Apple Silicon Macs. Go to **System Settings > Privacy & Security > FileVault** to enable it.

### Use a strong password manager

Reusing passwords across services is one of the most common ways accounts get compromised. A password manager generates unique, strong credentials for every site and fills them in automatically. Apple's built-in Passwords app has improved significantly, but dedicated managers like 1Password and Bitwarden offer more flexibility.

### Be cautious with browser extensions

Browser extensions can request broad permissions that grant access to your browsing data, form inputs, and even stored passwords. Install only extensions from trusted developers, review their permissions carefully, and remove any you no longer actively use.

### Secure your home network

Your Mac's security is only as strong as the network it connects to. Make sure your router firmware is up to date, use WPA3 encryption, change the default admin password, and consider setting up a guest network for IoT devices. Our complete guide on [how to secure your home network](/posts/how-to-secure-your-home-network-2026/) covers this topic in depth.

### Enable the macOS firewall

The built-in macOS firewall is disabled by default. Turn it on in **System Settings > Network > Firewall**. While it only blocks incoming connections (not outbound), it adds a meaningful layer of protection against network-based attacks. For outbound monitoring, consider a product like Intego NetBarrier or Little Snitch.

### Be wary of software from outside the App Store

macOS Gatekeeper warns you when you try to open software from unidentified developers, and it is tempting to click through those warnings. Resist the urge unless you are absolutely certain about the source. Sideloaded applications are the primary vector for Mac malware infections.

---

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do Macs get viruses?

Yes. While Macs are targeted less frequently than Windows PCs in absolute numbers, macOS malware is real and growing. In 2025, security researchers cataloged over 20 new Mac malware families, including info-stealers like Atomic Stealer (AMOS) and Realst, which specifically target macOS credentials, cryptocurrency wallets, and browser data. The long-standing myth that Macs are immune to viruses is exactly that: a myth. Modern Macs absolutely benefit from dedicated antivirus protection.

### Is the built-in macOS security enough?

Apple's XProtect, Gatekeeper, and Malware Removal Tool (MRT) provide a baseline level of protection, but they have significant limitations. XProtect relies on a relatively small signature database that is updated less frequently than commercial antivirus products. It does not offer real-time behavioral analysis, web protection, or anti-phishing tools. For users who browse the web, download software, or open email attachments, a dedicated antivirus product provides meaningfully stronger protection.

### Which is the best free antivirus for Mac?

Among free options, Avast Free Security for Mac and AVG AntiVirus for Mac (both owned by the same parent company) offer decent basic malware detection. However, free products typically lack real-time web protection, anti-phishing tools, and premium support. They may also collect and monetize user data to support the free model. Given that quality Mac antivirus products start at under $25 per year, we recommend investing in a paid solution for comprehensive protection.

### Will antivirus slow down my Mac?

Modern Mac antivirus products, especially those optimized for Apple Silicon, have minimal performance impact. In our testing, the best products (Bitdefender and ESET) added less than 2% overhead during typical workloads. You are unlikely to notice any difference in everyday use. Heavier suites like Norton 360 can produce perceptible slowdowns during full scans, but even those are modest on current hardware.

### Can I use a VPN instead of antivirus on my Mac?

No. A VPN and an antivirus serve fundamentally different purposes. A VPN encrypts your internet traffic and protects your privacy on the network level, but it does nothing to detect or remove malware, block phishing sites, or scan downloaded files. Similarly, an antivirus protects against threats on your device but does not encrypt your internet connection. For comprehensive security, we recommend using both. Products like Norton 360 include a bundled VPN, or you can pair your antivirus with a standalone VPN service like <a href="https://go.nordvpn.net/aff_c?offer_id=612&aff_id=141337&url_id=14830" rel="nofollow sponsored" target="_blank">NordVPN</a>.

### How often should I run a full antivirus scan on my Mac?

With real-time protection enabled, a dedicated full-system scan is less critical than it once was, because files are scanned as they are accessed, downloaded, or executed. That said, we recommend running a full scan at least **once per week** to catch anything that may have slipped through or been present before the antivirus was installed. Most products let you schedule automatic scans during off-peak hours.

### Do I need antivirus on an M-series Mac?

Yes. While Apple Silicon Macs benefit from strong hardware security features, including Secure Enclave and signed system volumes, these protections guard the integrity of the operating system itself. They do not prevent you from downloading and running malicious applications, falling for phishing attacks, or encountering malicious websites. Software-level antivirus protection remains necessary regardless of your Mac's processor architecture.

---

## Final Recommendation: Which Mac Antivirus Should You Choose?

After extensive testing, our top recommendation for most Mac users in 2026 is **Bitdefender Antivirus for Mac**. It combines near-perfect malware detection, minimal system impact, effective web protection, and a clean user experience at a competitive price. It is the rare product that makes no meaningful compromises in any category.

<a href="https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?mid=11660&id=2776410" class="cta" rel="nofollow sponsored" target="_blank">Get Bitdefender Antivirus for Mac</a>

If you are deeply embedded in the Apple ecosystem and want a product designed exclusively for macOS, **Intego Mac Internet Security** is the specialist choice. Its built-in firewall and Mac-native interface set it apart.

If budget is your primary concern, **Kaspersky Internet Security for Mac** offers outstanding protection at the lowest price point in our roundup. Just be aware of the geopolitical considerations discussed above.

For users who want the lightest possible footprint on system resources, **ESET Cyber Security** is the product to beat. Developers, musicians, and video editors who need every ounce of CPU and RAM for their creative tools will appreciate its efficiency.

And if you want the most features in a single package, including a VPN, password manager, cloud backup, and dark web monitoring, **Norton 360** delivers the widest feature set, though at a higher cost and heavier system footprint.

No matter which product you choose, the most important step is choosing one at all. The days of Macs being safe without antivirus protection are over. Investing a few minutes in setup and a modest annual subscription is one of the best things you can do for your digital security in 2026.
