## Why You Need a VPN in 2026

Before we get into the setup steps, let's quickly cover why a VPN matters. If you already know this, [skip to the setup instructions](#choosing-the-right-vpn).

### Privacy from Your ISP
Your Internet Service Provider (ISP) can see every website you visit. In many countries, ISPs are legally allowed to collect and sell this browsing data to advertisers. A VPN encrypts your traffic so your ISP sees nothing but scrambled data.

### Security on Public Wi-Fi
Coffee shops, airports, hotels, and libraries all offer free Wi-Fi — and they're all hunting grounds for hackers. On an unsecured network, an attacker sitting in the same room can intercept your passwords, emails, and banking details. A VPN creates an encrypted tunnel that makes this impossible.

### Bypass Geo-Restrictions
Streaming libraries vary by country. Content available on Netflix US may not be available in Europe, and vice versa. A VPN lets you connect through a server in another country, unlocking content that's normally restricted in your region. For more on this, see our guide to the [best VPNs for streaming](/posts/best-vpn-for-streaming-2026/).

### Stop ISP Throttling
Some ISPs deliberately slow down your connection when they detect streaming, gaming, or large downloads. Because a VPN encrypts your traffic, your ISP can't tell what you're doing — so they can't selectively throttle you.

## What Is a VPN? A Simple Explanation

VPN stands for **Virtual Private Network**. Here's how it works in plain English:

1. **Without a VPN:** Your device connects directly to websites. Your ISP can see everything, and websites can see your real IP address (which reveals your approximate location).

2. **With a VPN:** Your device first connects to a VPN server through an encrypted tunnel. The VPN server then connects to websites on your behalf. Your ISP sees only encrypted data going to the VPN server, and websites see the VPN server's IP address instead of yours.

Think of it like sending a letter through a trusted intermediary instead of mailing it directly. The postal service (your ISP) only sees that you sent something to the intermediary — they can't read the letter or see the final recipient.

The encryption part is critical. Even if someone intercepts your data mid-transit, they get nothing but gibberish.

## How to Set Up a VPN on iPhone and iPad

iOS makes VPN setup extremely simple thanks to the App Store.

### Step 1: Download the App

1. Open the **App Store** on your iPhone or iPad
2. Search for your VPN provider (e.g., "NordVPN")
3. Tap **Get** and confirm with Face ID, Touch ID, or your Apple ID password
4. Wait for the app to install

### Step 2: Log In and Allow VPN Configuration

1. Open the VPN app
2. Log in with your account credentials (or create an account if you haven't already)
3. The app will ask to **Add VPN Configurations** — tap **Allow**
4. Authenticate with Face ID, Touch ID, or your passcode

This is a standard iOS permission. It allows the app to create a VPN tunnel on your device.

### Step 3: Connect

1. Tap the **Quick Connect** button
2. You'll see a small **VPN** label appear in the status bar at the top of your screen
3. You're now protected

### Step 4: Recommended Settings

1. Go to the app's **Settings**
2. Enable **Auto-connect on Wi-Fi** — this is especially important on mobile, since you'll often connect to public Wi-Fi networks
3. Enable the **Kill Switch** (called "VPN Kill Switch" in NordVPN's iOS app)
4. Choose the **NordLynx** or **WireGuard** protocol for the best battery life and speed on mobile

**Tip:** On iOS, you can also check your VPN status by going to **Settings > General > VPN & Device Management**. You'll see whether the VPN tunnel is active.

---

## How to Set Up a VPN on Android

Android gives you slightly more flexibility than iOS when it comes to VPN configuration.

### Step 1: Download the App

1. Open the **Google Play Store**
2. Search for your VPN provider (e.g., "NordVPN")
3. Tap **Install**
4. Wait for the app to download and install

### Step 2: Log In and Allow Permissions

1. Open the VPN app
2. Log in with your account credentials
3. The app will ask for a **Connection request** — tap **OK** to allow the VPN to set up a network connection
4. This is a standard Android permission that all VPN apps require

### Step 3: Connect

1. Tap **Quick Connect**
2. A small **key icon** will appear in your notification bar — this means the VPN is active
3. You'll also see a persistent notification from the VPN app showing your connection status

### Step 4: Recommended Settings

1. Open the app's **Settings**
2. Enable **Auto-connect** so the VPN activates automatically
3. Enable **Kill Switch** — on Android, this can also be enabled at the system level:
   - Go to **Android Settings > Network & Internet > VPN**
   - Tap the gear icon next to your VPN
   - Enable **Always-on VPN** and **Block connections without VPN**
4. Set the protocol to **NordLynx** or **WireGuard**
5. Enable **Split Tunneling** if you want certain apps (like banking apps that block VPNs) to bypass the VPN connection

**Android system-level kill switch** is particularly powerful because it works even if the VPN app crashes. We strongly recommend enabling it.

## How to Set Up a VPN on a Router

Installing a VPN on your router protects **every device on your network** — including smart TVs, game consoles, IoT devices, and anything else that can't run a VPN app natively. For more tips on securing all your connected devices, see our guide on [how to secure your home network](/posts/how-to-secure-your-home-network-2026/).

### Why Use a Router VPN?

- Protects devices that don't support VPN apps (smart TVs, game consoles, smart home devices)
- Counts as only **one connection** toward your VPN subscription limit
- Set it once and forget it — all traffic is automatically encrypted

### Option 1: Use a VPN-Compatible Router (Easiest)

Many modern routers support VPN connections natively. Check if yours does:

**Routers with built-in VPN client support:**
- Most ASUS routers (RT-AX86U, RT-AX88U, etc.)
- Routers running DD-WRT or OpenWrt firmware
- GL.iNet travel routers
- Vilfo VPN router

### Option 2: Flash Custom Firmware

If your router doesn't support VPN connections natively, you can often flash custom firmware like **DD-WRT** or **OpenWrt** that adds VPN support. This is more advanced and carries some risk — if done incorrectly, you could brick your router.

### Step-by-Step: Setting Up NordVPN on an ASUS Router

1. **Log into your router's admin panel** — open a browser and go to `192.168.1.1` (or your router's address)
2. Go to **VPN** in the left sidebar
3. Click the **VPN Client** tab
4. Click **Add profile**
5. Select the **OpenVPN** tab
6. Enter the following:
   - **Description:** NordVPN
   - **Username:** Your NordVPN service username (found in the NordVPN dashboard under "Manual Setup")
   - **Password:** Your NordVPN service password
7. **Upload the .ovpn configuration file** — download this from NordVPN's server recommendation tool on their website
8. Click **OK**, then click **Activate**
9. Wait 30 seconds. The **Connection Status** should show "Connected"

### Important Notes About Router VPNs

- Router VPN connections typically use **OpenVPN**, which is slower than NordLynx/WireGuard. Expect some speed reduction.
- You can't easily switch servers — you'll need to log into the router admin panel to change the server.
- Consider running the VPN on individual devices for better speeds, and using the router VPN only for devices that can't run VPN apps.

## How to Set Up a VPN on Smart TV and Streaming Devices

Smart TVs, Roku, Apple TV, Fire TV Stick, and Chromecast don't all support VPN apps directly. Here are your options for each:

### Amazon Fire TV Stick (Easiest)

Fire TV Stick supports VPN apps directly from the Amazon App Store.

1. Go to **Search** on your Fire TV Stick
2. Search for "NordVPN" (or your VPN provider)
3. Install the app
4. Open it and sign in
5. Click **Quick Connect**

This is by far the simplest way to get a VPN on a streaming device.

### Apple TV (tvOS 17+)

Apple TV gained native VPN support with tvOS 17. NordVPN and other major providers now offer Apple TV apps.

1. Open the **App Store** on your Apple TV
2. Search for your VPN provider
3. Download and install the app
4. Sign in and connect

### Android TV / Google TV

Like Fire TV, Android TV supports VPN apps directly.

1. Open the **Google Play Store** on your TV
2. Search for and install your VPN app
3. Sign in and connect

### Smart TVs Without VPN App Support (Samsung, LG, etc.)

For smart TVs that don't support VPN apps, you have two options:

1. **Set up the VPN on your router** (see the router section above) — this will cover your smart TV along with every other device
2. **Use Smart DNS** — NordVPN includes a Smart DNS feature (called SmartPlay) that lets you unblock streaming content without installing a VPN app. It doesn't encrypt your traffic, but it does handle geo-unblocking.

To set up Smart DNS:
1. Log into your NordVPN account dashboard
2. Go to **Services > SmartDNS**
3. Activate it and note the DNS addresses provided
4. On your smart TV, go to **Network Settings > DNS Settings**
5. Enter the DNS addresses manually
6. Restart your TV

## VPN Settings Explained

Most VPN apps work perfectly with default settings, but understanding these options helps you get the best performance and security.

### VPN Protocols

A protocol is the set of rules that determines how your VPN tunnel is created. Here are the main ones:

| Protocol | Speed | Security | Best For |
|----------|-------|----------|----------|
| **WireGuard / NordLynx** | Fastest | Excellent | Daily use, streaming, gaming |
| **OpenVPN (UDP)** | Good | Excellent | Router setups, when WireGuard isn't available |
| **OpenVPN (TCP)** | Slower | Excellent | Restrictive networks that block UDP |
| **IKEv2/IPSec** | Fast | Excellent | Mobile devices (handles network switching well) |

**Our recommendation:** Use **WireGuard** (or **NordLynx**, which is NordVPN's implementation of WireGuard) for everyday use. It's the fastest and most modern protocol.

### Kill Switch

A kill switch is a safety net. If your VPN connection drops unexpectedly — even for a split second — the kill switch immediately blocks all internet traffic until the VPN reconnects. Without it, your real IP address and unencrypted data could leak during that gap.

**Always enable the kill switch.** There is no downside. If the VPN drops, you lose internet access for a few seconds until it reconnects — which is far better than accidentally exposing your data.

### Split Tunneling

Split tunneling lets you choose which apps or websites use the VPN and which connect directly. This is useful for:

- **Banking apps** that block VPN connections
- **Local network devices** like printers or NAS drives
- **Speed-sensitive apps** where you don't need VPN protection

For example, you could route your browser through the VPN for privacy while letting your banking app connect directly.

### DNS Leak Protection

When you visit a website, your device sends a DNS request to translate the domain name (like "google.com") into an IP address. Without DNS leak protection, these requests might bypass the VPN and go to your ISP's DNS servers — revealing which websites you visit even though the rest of your traffic is encrypted.

Good VPN apps handle this automatically by routing all DNS requests through the VPN tunnel and using their own secure DNS servers. NordVPN and Surfshark both handle DNS leak protection by default.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

After helping countless readers set up their VPNs, these are the mistakes we see most often:

### 1. Using a Free VPN
Free VPNs have to make money somehow. Most do it by logging your browsing data and selling it to advertisers — the exact thing you're trying to prevent. Some inject ads into your browsing. Others have been caught containing malware. If you're not paying for the product, you are the product.

### 2. Forgetting to Enable the Kill Switch
The VPN connection can drop for many reasons — a brief Wi-Fi interruption, switching from Wi-Fi to mobile data, or a server issue. Without a kill switch, your real IP address is exposed during these moments.

### 3. Using the Wrong Protocol
Some VPN apps default to older, slower protocols. Make sure you're using **WireGuard** or **NordLynx** for the best speeds. The difference can be dramatic — up to 3-5x faster than older protocols in some cases.

### 4. Not Enabling Auto-Connect
If you have to remember to manually turn on your VPN every time, you'll forget. Enable auto-connect so the VPN starts whenever your device boots up or connects to a network.

### 5. Connecting to a Distant Server When You Don't Need To
The farther the VPN server is from your physical location, the slower your connection will be. If you just want privacy (not geo-unblocking), always use **Quick Connect** or choose the nearest server.

### 6. Assuming the VPN Protects Against Everything
A VPN protects your internet traffic. It doesn't protect you from phishing emails, downloading malware, using weak passwords, or clicking on suspicious links. A VPN is one layer of your security — not the only layer.

---

## Troubleshooting Common VPN Issues

### VPN Won't Connect

1. **Check your internet connection** — make sure you can access websites without the VPN
2. **Try a different server** — the server you're connecting to might be temporarily overloaded
3. **Switch protocols** — if WireGuard doesn't work, try OpenVPN (or vice versa)
4. **Restart the VPN app**
5. **Restart your device**
6. **Check your firewall** — your firewall or antivirus software might be blocking the VPN connection
7. **Update the VPN app** — outdated apps can have connection issues

### VPN Is Slow

1. **Connect to a closer server** — distance is the biggest factor in VPN speed
2. **Switch to WireGuard/NordLynx** — it's the fastest protocol
3. **Disconnect and reconnect** — you might have been assigned a congested server
4. **Try a wired connection** instead of Wi-Fi
5. **Close bandwidth-heavy applications** running in the background
6. **Check if your base internet speed is slow** — disconnect the VPN and run a speed test at <a href="https://www.speedtest.net" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">speedtest.net</a>

### Streaming Service Detects the VPN

Streaming platforms actively try to block VPN connections. If you get an error:

1. **Disconnect and reconnect** to get a different IP address
2. **Try a different server** in the same country
3. **Clear your browser cookies and cache** — old cookies can reveal your real location
4. **Use a dedicated/obfuscated server** if your VPN offers one
5. **Make sure your VPN app is updated** — providers constantly add new IPs to stay ahead of blocks

NordVPN and Surfshark are both consistently effective at unblocking streaming platforms. See our [best VPNs for streaming](/posts/best-vpn-for-streaming-2026/) guide for specific recommendations.

### VPN Keeps Disconnecting

1. **Switch protocols** — try WireGuard, OpenVPN UDP, or IKEv2
2. **Check your Wi-Fi signal** — weak Wi-Fi causes VPN drops
3. **Disable battery optimization** for the VPN app (especially on Android) — battery savers can kill VPN connections in the background
4. **Update your VPN app and OS**
5. **Try a different server**

### IP or DNS Leak Detected

If you run a leak test (at sites like <a href="https://ipleak.net" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ipleak.net</a>) and see your real IP address:

1. Make sure **DNS leak protection** is enabled in the VPN settings
2. Enable the **kill switch**
3. Disable **IPv6** on your device (some VPNs don't tunnel IPv6 traffic)
4. Make sure you're not using split tunneling for the browser you tested with
5. Try a different VPN protocol

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is using a VPN legal?

Yes, using a VPN is completely legal in most countries, including the United States, Canada, the UK, Australia, and all EU countries. A VPN is a legitimate privacy tool, much like using HTTPS or an ad blocker. However, what you do while connected to a VPN still has to be legal — a VPN doesn't make illegal activities legal. A handful of countries restrict or ban VPN use (China, Russia, North Korea, etc.), so check local laws if you're in or traveling to a restrictive country.

### Will a VPN slow down my internet?

Slightly, yes — but with a good VPN, the difference is barely noticeable. Because your traffic is being encrypted and routed through an additional server, there's inherently some overhead. With NordVPN using the NordLynx protocol, we typically see only a 5-10% speed reduction on nearby servers. For most people, this is undetectable during normal browsing, streaming, or even gaming.

### Can I use one VPN subscription on multiple devices?

Yes. NordVPN allows up to **10 simultaneous connections** on one account, and Surfshark offers **unlimited connections**. This means you can protect your computer, phone, tablet, and more — all with a single subscription. If you install the VPN on your router, it counts as just one connection but protects every device on your network.

### Do I need to keep the VPN on all the time?

We recommend keeping it on whenever possible, especially on public Wi-Fi or when browsing content you'd prefer to keep private. The main reasons you might turn it off are if a specific website or app blocks VPN connections (some banking apps do), or if you need maximum speed for a large download. With modern protocols like WireGuard, the performance impact is so small that there's little reason to turn it off.

### Will a VPN protect me on public Wi-Fi?

Absolutely — this is one of the most important reasons to use a VPN. Public Wi-Fi networks at coffee shops, airports, hotels, and other locations are notoriously insecure. Without a VPN, anyone on the same network could potentially intercept your data. A VPN encrypts everything, making it unreadable even if intercepted. Always connect your VPN before doing anything sensitive on public Wi-Fi.

### Can my ISP see that I'm using a VPN?

Your ISP can see that you're connected to a VPN server, but they cannot see what you're doing through that connection. All they see is encrypted data going to a single IP address. They cannot see which websites you visit, what you download, or what you stream. If you want to hide the fact that you're using a VPN, some providers (including NordVPN) offer **obfuscated servers** that disguise VPN traffic as regular HTTPS traffic.

### What's the difference between a VPN app and a browser extension?

A VPN app protects **all internet traffic** from your device — every app, every browser, every background process. A VPN browser extension only protects traffic within that specific browser. If you're using a VPN browser extension and open a separate app (like a messaging app or email client), that traffic is not protected. For full protection, always use the VPN app rather than just a browser extension.
