faq:
  - q: "Is ESET a good antivirus in 2026?"
    a: "Yes. ESET consistently scores 99.5%+ in independent malware detection tests while using fewer system resources than almost any competitor. It is especially well-suited for power users who want granular control over their security settings."
  - q: "Is ESET NOD32 enough or do I need ESET Internet Security?"
    a: "ESET NOD32 Antivirus provides excellent core malware protection. However, if you need a firewall, parental controls, webcam protection, or anti-spam, you should upgrade to ESET Internet Security. For a full smart home suite with password manager and encryption, choose Home Security Premium."
  - q: "Does ESET slow down your computer?"
    a: "ESET is one of the lightest antivirus solutions available. In our benchmarks it added only 2-4% overhead during everyday tasks like web browsing, file copying, and app launching. It is noticeably lighter than Norton, McAfee, and Kaspersky."
  - q: "How does ESET compare to Bitdefender?"
    a: "Bitdefender edges ahead in raw detection rates (99.9% vs 99.5%) and offers more bundled features like an unlimited VPN upgrade. ESET wins on resource usage, configurability, and advanced controls like HIPS and device management. Bitdefender suits most users; ESET suits power users."
  - q: "Does ESET have a VPN?"
    a: "ESET does not include a built-in VPN in any of its tiers. If you need a VPN, you will have to pair ESET with a standalone VPN service. This is one of ESET's notable gaps compared to competitors like Bitdefender and Norton."
  - q: "What is ESET HIPS and should I use it?"
    a: "HIPS stands for Host-based Intrusion Prevention System. It monitors system activity and applies predefined rules to block suspicious behavior at the operating system level. It is enabled by default in automatic mode, but advanced users can create custom rules for granular control."
  - q: "Can ESET protect Mac and Linux devices?"
    a: "Yes. ESET offers dedicated products for macOS and Linux. The macOS version includes real-time protection, web protection, and anti-phishing. The Linux version is more limited but provides on-demand and scheduled scanning for file servers and desktops."
  - q: "Is ESET's password manager any good?"
    a: "ESET's password manager, included only in Home Security Premium, is basic. It handles password storage, autofill, and generation but lacks features like breach monitoring, secure sharing, and passkey support. For serious password management we recommend a dedicated tool like NordPass or 1Password."

ESET is the antivirus I recommend to power users who care more about system performance and granular control than flashy dashboards. I have been running ESET on my primary workstation for years because it is the lightest paid antivirus I have ever tested -- and its HIPS gives me the kind of deep system monitoring that other suites hide or skip entirely. I put all three tiers through four months of rigorous testing to see if it still earns that recommendation in 2026.

**Bottom line:** ESET remains one of the best antivirus options for users who prioritize performance and control. Its detection rates are strong (if not quite chart-topping), its system impact is the lowest of any paid antivirus I tested, and its advanced tools like HIPS and device control give power users unmatched configurability. The trade-off is a dated interface, no built-in VPN, and a basic password manager.

## ESET Product Tiers at a Glance

Before diving into the details, it helps to understand what ESET offers. Unlike some competitors that sell a single product with everything bundled, ESET uses a three-tier structure that lets you pay only for what you need.

| Feature | NOD32 Antivirus | Internet Security | Home Security Premium |
|---------|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| **Real-Time Malware Protection** | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Anti-Phishing** | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **HIPS** | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Device Control** | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Exploit Blocker** | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Ransomware Shield** | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Firewall** | No | Yes | Yes |
| **Parental Controls** | No | Yes | Yes |
| **Webcam Protection** | No | Yes | Yes |
| **Anti-Spam** | No | Yes | Yes |
| **Network Inspector** | No | Yes | Yes |
| **Password Manager** | No | No | Yes |
| **Secure Data (Encryption)** | No | No | Yes |
| **Price (Year 1, 1 device)** | $39.99 | $49.99 | $59.99 |
| **Renewal Price** | $59.99 | $79.99 | $99.99 |

For most users, **ESET Internet Security** is the sweet spot. NOD32 is great if you only need core antivirus, while Home Security Premium adds the password manager and file encryption for those who want a single-vendor solution — though as we will discuss, the bundled extras are not best-in-class.

## Malware Detection and Protection

Protection is the primary job of any antivirus, and ESET performs well — though it does not quite match the very top scorers.

### Independent Lab Results

| Testing Lab | Score | Rating |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| AV-TEST (January 2026) | 99.5% detection | 5.5/6 |
| AV-Comparatives (Real-World) | 99.3% detection | Advanced+ |
| SE Labs (Q4 2025) | AAA rating | AAA |
| MRG Effitas (360 Assessment) | Level 1 certified | Pass |

ESET's 99.5% detection rate is excellent by any reasonable standard. The 0.4-0.5% gap compared to [Bitdefender's 99.9%](/posts/bitdefender-review-2026/) comes down to a handful of zero-day threats in the AV-TEST sample set. In day-to-day use, the practical difference is negligible for most users.

### Our Real-World Testing

We exposed ESET Internet Security to 500 live malware samples collected from phishing campaigns, malicious downloads, and exploit kits during my testing window. Results:

- **Known malware:** 100% detection (all 350 known samples caught on access)
- **Zero-day threats:** 98.7% detection (148 of 150 unknown samples blocked)
- **Phishing URLs:** 97.2% blocked (slightly below Bitdefender and Norton)
- **False positives:** 3 over 4 months (excellent — all involving obscure developer tools)

The two missed zero-day samples were both detected within 48 hours once ESET's cloud signatures updated, which is a reasonable turnaround.

### Multi-Layered Detection Engine

ESET's detection engine works in multiple stages:

1. **ESET LiveGrid Cloud** — Reputation checks against ESET's global threat database before files execute
2. **Machine Learning (Augur)** — On-device ML engine that classifies unknown binaries without needing cloud connectivity
3. **DNA Detections** — Behavioral signatures that identify malware families rather than individual hash values
4. **Exploit Blocker** — Monitors commonly exploited applications (browsers, PDF readers, Java) for abnormal behavior
5. **Ransomware Shield** — Dedicated behavioral layer that monitors for mass file encryption patterns
6. **HIPS** — System-level monitoring that enforces rules on process behavior, registry access, and more

This layered approach is what keeps ESET effective despite the slightly lower headline detection numbers. The engine catches threats through behavior analysis even when signature-based detection misses.

## System Performance: Where ESET Truly Excels

If there is one area where ESET consistently beats every competitor, it is resource usage. This has been ESET's calling card for decades, and it remains true in 2026.

### Our Benchmark Results

I tested on a mid-range system (Intel Core i5-13400, 16 GB RAM, NVMe SSD) running Windows 11, measuring the overhead added by ESET Internet Security compared to running with no antivirus:

| Task | No AV | ESET | Overhead |
|------|-------|------|----------|
| System Boot | 14.2s | 14.5s | +2.1% |
| File Copy (5 GB) | 18.1s | 18.6s | +2.8% |
| App Launch (avg 10 apps) | 1.8s | 1.85s | +2.8% |
| Web Browsing (page load avg) | 1.2s | 1.22s | +1.7% |
| Full Scan Time | N/A | 22 min | — |
| RAM Usage (idle) | — | 85 MB | — |
| RAM Usage (scanning) | — | 210 MB | — |

For comparison, [Bitdefender](/posts/bitdefender-review-2026/) added 3-6% overhead in the same tests, and [Kaspersky](/posts/kaspersky-review-2026/) added 4-7%. Norton and McAfee were even heavier.

ESET's idle RAM footprint of 85 MB is remarkable. Most competitors sit between 150-300 MB at idle. If you run resource-intensive applications — video editing, 3D rendering, gaming, software development — ESET gives you back more of your system than any other paid antivirus.

### Gaming Mode

ESET includes a Gaming Mode that suppresses notifications, postpones scheduled scans, and minimizes background activity when a full-screen application is running. In my testing, enabling Gaming Mode reduced ESET's impact to virtually zero during gameplay sessions. Frame rates were identical with and without ESET running.

---

## HIPS: The Power User's Secret Weapon

ESET's Host-based Intrusion Prevention System is the feature that most separates it from consumer-focused competitors. While other antivirus products hide their internals behind simple toggles, HIPS gives you direct control over how applications interact with your operating system.

### How HIPS Works

HIPS monitors four categories of system activity:

- **Files** — Rules for which processes can read, write, or delete specific files and directories
- **Registry** — Rules for which processes can modify Windows Registry keys
- **Applications** — Rules for which processes can launch other processes, inject code, or modify memory
- **Devices** — Rules for which processes can access specific hardware devices

### Automatic vs Interactive Mode

In **Automatic Mode** (the default), HIPS uses a built-in ruleset to silently block known-bad behaviors. Most users should leave this as-is.

In **Interactive Mode**, HIPS prompts you to approve or deny every unrecognized system action. This generates a lot of pop-ups initially but allows you to build a comprehensive whitelist tailored to your exact workflow. Power users and system administrators love this level of control.

In **Smart Mode**, HIPS operates in automatic mode but prompts for actions that fall outside its predefined rules. This is a good middle ground for technically proficient users who do not want the firehose of Interactive Mode.

### Custom Rules

You can create granular HIPS rules such as:

- Block all applications except your browser from accessing your Documents folder
- Prevent any unsigned process from modifying registry startup keys
- Allow a specific development tool to inject code into its own processes while blocking all other code injection

This is the kind of control you simply do not get with [consumer-focused suites like Norton or McAfee](/posts/best-antivirus-software-2026/). If you manage your own systems and understand what these rules mean, HIPS is incredibly powerful.

---

## Device Control

Another advanced feature that distinguishes ESET is its device control module, available in all three tiers.

Device control lets you set rules for removable media and external devices:

- **Block all USB storage devices** except for specific whitelisted serial numbers
- **Allow read-only access** to USB drives (prevent data exfiltration)
- **Block Bluetooth devices** by class (e.g., allow Bluetooth keyboards but block file transfers)
- **Control CD/DVD access** and FireWire devices
- **Log all device connections** for audit purposes

For home users, this is useful if you share a computer and want to prevent unauthorized USB devices. For small business users and IT professionals, this is a genuine enterprise-grade feature included in a consumer product.

---

## Firewall and Network Protection (Internet Security and Above)

ESET Internet Security and Home Security Premium include a two-way firewall that replaces the Windows Firewall.

### Firewall Features

- **Application-based rules** — Allow or block network access per application
- **Zone-based profiles** — Automatic profile switching based on whether you are on a trusted home network, public Wi-Fi, or a work network
- **IDS (Intrusion Detection System)** — Monitors network traffic for known attack patterns
- **Botnet protection** — Detects outbound communication with known command-and-control servers

The firewall is competent but not exceptional. It lacks the visual network map that Bitdefender offers, and the rule configuration interface could use modernization. However, it is functional and provides more control than the Windows built-in firewall.

### Network Inspector

The Network Inspector scans your local network for connected devices, open ports, and vulnerabilities. It identified our test router's outdated firmware and flagged an IoT camera with default credentials — useful for keeping your [home network secure](/posts/how-to-secure-your-home-network-2026/).

---

## Webcam and Anti-Spam Protection

### Webcam Protection

Available in Internet Security and above, webcam protection alerts you whenever an application attempts to access your camera and lets you whitelist trusted applications. It works reliably in my testing, catching both legitimate video calls and test scripts attempting unauthorized access.

### Anti-Spam

ESET's anti-spam module integrates with Microsoft Outlook and filters incoming email for spam and [phishing attempts](/posts/how-to-protect-yourself-from-phishing-2026/). It uses a combination of heuristics, Bayesian filtering, and blacklists. The catch rate was decent at roughly 95% of spam blocked, but most users now rely on their email provider's built-in spam filtering, making this less essential than it once was.

---

## Password Manager (Home Security Premium Only)

ESET's password manager is bundled exclusively with the Home Security Premium tier. We need to be honest here: it is basic.

### What It Does

- Stores passwords with AES-256 encryption
- Autofills login forms in major browsers
- Generates random passwords
- Syncs across devices via ESET's cloud

### What It Lacks

- No breach monitoring or password health scoring
- No secure password sharing
- No passkey support
- No secure notes or document storage
- Limited import/export options
- No standalone app (browser extension only)

If you are currently using no password manager at all, ESET's offering is better than nothing. But if you are serious about password security — and you should be — we strongly recommend a dedicated solution. See our guide to the [best password managers in 2026](/posts/best-password-managers-2026/) or our [1Password vs Bitwarden comparison](/posts/1password-vs-bitwarden-2026/) for much better options.

The same applies to ESET's encrypted storage feature in Home Security Premium. It works, but dedicated encryption tools like VeraCrypt offer more flexibility at no cost.

## What ESET Is Missing: The Honest Gaps

No review is complete without acknowledging where a product falls short. ESET has several notable gaps compared to the competition.

### No Built-In VPN

In 2026, most major antivirus suites include at least a basic VPN. Bitdefender, Norton, Kaspersky, McAfee, and Avast all bundle VPN functionality. ESET does not. If you need a VPN — and you probably do, especially on public Wi-Fi — you will need a separate service. Check our [best VPN services roundup](/posts/best-vpn-services-2026/) for recommendations.

### Dated Interface

ESET's desktop interface looks like it was designed in 2018 and has received only minor cosmetic updates since. Everything works, but the layout is cluttered, the settings are buried in nested menus, and the overall aesthetic feels behind the times compared to Bitdefender's clean modern dashboard or Norton's streamlined design.

### Limited Parental Controls

The parental controls in Internet Security and above are functional but rudimentary. You get website category blocking and content filtering, but there is no time management, app usage monitoring, or location tracking that products like Norton Family and Kaspersky Safe Kids offer.

### No Identity Theft Protection

Unlike Norton 360 and McAfee+, ESET does not offer identity monitoring, dark web scanning, or credit monitoring. For identity protection, you would need to pair ESET with a separate identity theft protection service.

## ESET vs the Competition

How does ESET stack up against the other major antivirus products?

| Feature | ESET Internet Security | Bitdefender Total Security | Kaspersky Plus | Norton 360 Deluxe |
|---------|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| **Detection Rate** | 99.5% | 99.9% | 99.8% | 99.7% |
| **Performance Impact** | 2-4% | 3-6% | 4-7% | 5-9% |
| **Built-In VPN** | No | Yes (200 MB/day) | Yes (unlimited) | Yes (unlimited) |
| **Password Manager** | Basic (Premium only) | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **HIPS/Advanced Controls** | Excellent | Limited | Good | No |
| **Device Control** | Yes | No | No | No |

## Pricing and Plans

ESET's pricing is competitive for the first year, though renewal prices jump significantly — a common industry practice.

| Plan | Year 1 (1 device) | Renewal (1 device) | Year 1 (5 devices) | Renewal (5 devices) |
|------|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| **NOD32 Antivirus** | $39.99 | $59.99 | $59.99 | $89.99 |
| **Internet Security** | $49.99 | $79.99 | $69.99 | $109.99 |
| **Home Security Premium** | $59.99 | $99.99 | $89.99 | $139.99 |

Multi-year discounts are available (2-year and 3-year plans reduce the per-year cost by roughly 15-25%), and ESET frequently runs promotions during Black Friday and holiday periods.

All plans include a **30-day free trial** and a **30-day money-back guarantee**, so you can test the full product risk-free.

---

## Installation and Setup

Installing ESET is straightforward. Download the installer from eset.com, run it, and you are protected within about five minutes. The installer is small (under 100 MB) and does not require a reboot.

During setup, ESET asks whether you want to enable detection of potentially unwanted applications (PUAs). I recommend enabling this — it catches bundled adware and toolbars that are technically legal but unwanted.

The initial scan took 22 minutes on our test system with a 512 GB NVMe SSD containing roughly 350,000 files. Subsequent scans were significantly faster (under 8 minutes) thanks to smart caching.

---

## Who Should Choose ESET?

ESET is not the best antivirus for everyone. Here is who it suits best.

### ESET Is Ideal For:

- **Power users and IT professionals** who want granular control via HIPS and device control
- **Gamers and content creators** who need the absolute lightest system footprint
- **Developers** who encounter frequent false positives with more aggressive scanners
- **Older or lower-spec hardware** where every megabyte of RAM matters
- **Linux and macOS users** who want cross-platform coverage from one vendor
- **Small businesses** that need enterprise-like device control without enterprise pricing

### ESET Is Not Ideal For:

- **Non-technical users** who want a set-it-and-forget-it experience (Bitdefender or Norton are better here)
- **Anyone who wants an all-in-one suite** with VPN, password manager, and identity protection bundled
- **Families** who need robust parental controls
- **Users who prioritize the absolute highest detection rates** (Bitdefender and Kaspersky score slightly higher)

## Final Verdict: 8.5/10

ESET is the antivirus for people who understand what an antivirus does and want precise control over how it does it. The HIPS system, device control, and featherweight resource usage make it uniquely appealing to power users, IT professionals, gamers, and developers.

However, it is not the best choice for users who want the most comprehensive out-of-the-box protection suite. The lack of a VPN, basic password manager, and limited bundled extras mean you will need to supplement ESET with standalone tools. If you prefer a single integrated solution, [Bitdefender Total Security](/posts/bitdefender-review-2026/) or Kaspersky Plus offer more features for a similar price.

If lightweight performance and advanced controls are your priorities, ESET deserves a spot on your shortlist. The 30-day free trial makes it easy to test before committing.
