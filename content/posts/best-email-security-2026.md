faq:
  - q: "Why do I need email security beyond my email provider's built-in protection?"
    a: "Built-in protections from Microsoft 365 and Google Workspace catch about 85-90% of threats. Dedicated email security solutions add AI-powered analysis, advanced phishing detection, BEC protection, and URL rewriting that catch the remaining 10-15% — which includes the most sophisticated and dangerous attacks."
  - q: "What is Business Email Compromise (BEC)?"
    a: "BEC is when attackers impersonate a CEO, vendor, or colleague to trick employees into transferring money or sharing sensitive data. BEC attacks caused over $2.7 billion in losses in 2025. Unlike phishing, BEC emails often contain no malicious links or attachments — just convincing social engineering."
  - q: "What is the best email security for small businesses?"
    a: "For Microsoft 365 users, Microsoft Defender for Office 365 Plan 1 (€1.90/user/month) is the best starting point — it's affordable and deeply integrated. For Google Workspace, Avanan (now Check Point Harmony Email) provides the best protection. For any platform, IRONSCALES offers the best value with built-in training."
  - q: "How does AI improve email security?"
    a: "AI analyzes email patterns to detect anomalies: unusual sender behavior, writing style changes, suspicious timing, and social engineering tactics. Unlike rule-based filters, AI adapts to new attack methods and can detect zero-day phishing campaigns before signatures are available. It also reduces false positives."
  - q: "What is DMARC, SPF, and DKIM?"
    a: "These are email authentication protocols that prevent spoofing of your domain. SPF specifies which servers can send email for your domain. DKIM adds a cryptographic signature to verify the email wasn't modified. DMARC ties them together and tells receiving servers what to do with failures (reject, quarantine, or allow)."
  - q: "How much does email security cost?"
    a: "Prices range from €1.90/user/month (Microsoft Defender Plan 1) to €6-€10/user/month (enterprise solutions like Proofpoint and Mimecast). For a 10-person business, expect €20-€100/month. The ROI is significant: the average phishing attack costs businesses €15,000-€50,000."

I have personally analyzed hundreds of phishing emails that sailed right past Microsoft 365 and Google Workspace filters -- convincing BEC attacks, zero-day payloads, AI-crafted social engineering that built-in protection simply was not designed to catch. With 91% of cyberattacks starting with an email, the default filters are not enough for any business that takes security seriously.
