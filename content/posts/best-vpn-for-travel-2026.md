faq:
  - q: "Do I really need a VPN when traveling?"
    a: "Yes. Public Wi-Fi networks in hotels, airports, cafes, and co-working spaces are prime targets for man-in-the-middle attacks and packet sniffing. A VPN encrypts all your internet traffic so attackers on the same network cannot intercept your data, passwords, or financial information."
  - q: "Can I use a free VPN for travel?"
    a: "We do not recommend it. Free VPNs typically have slow speeds, data caps, limited server locations, and questionable privacy practices. Some free VPNs have been caught selling user data. For travel, where reliable security is critical, invest in a paid VPN like NordVPN or Surfshark."
  - q: "Will a VPN work in China?"
    a: "Standard VPN connections are blocked by China's Great Firewall. However, NordVPN and ExpressVPN offer obfuscated servers specifically designed to bypass these blocks. Success rates vary and may require trying multiple servers. Install and configure your VPN before entering China."
  - q: "Does a VPN slow down my internet?"
    a: "A good VPN adds 5-15% overhead on fast connections. On slow hotel or airport Wi-Fi, the impact is usually negligible because the base speed is already the bottleneck. NordVPN and ExpressVPN are the fastest VPNs we tested and cause minimal slowdown."
  - q: "Can I access my streaming services while traveling abroad?"
    a: "Yes. By connecting to a VPN server in your home country, you can access Netflix, Hulu, BBC iPlayer, and other streaming services as if you were at home. NordVPN and Surfshark are the most reliable for streaming. See our best VPN for streaming guide for details."
  - q: "How many devices does a VPN cover?"
    a: "NordVPN covers 10 devices simultaneously, Surfshark covers unlimited devices, ExpressVPN covers 8, and ProtonVPN covers 10. For travelers with a phone, laptop, and tablet, any of these provide enough coverage."
  - q: "Is it legal to use a VPN while traveling?"
    a: "VPNs are legal in most countries. They are restricted or banned in China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, Turkmenistan, and Belarus. In the UAE, VPNs are legal but using one to access banned content is not. In most of the world including the US, EU, UK, Japan, and Australia, VPNs are completely legal."
  - q: "Should I leave my VPN on all the time while traveling?"
    a: "Yes. Set your VPN to auto-connect whenever you join a Wi-Fi network. The only time to disconnect is if a specific local service requires a local IP address, such as hotel room controls or local payment apps."

You have just landed in a new city. You connect to the airport Wi-Fi to check your email, look up directions, and message your family. What you might not realize is that everyone else on that network can potentially see what you are doing — and it takes remarkably little technical skill to intercept unencrypted traffic on public Wi-Fi.

A VPN solves this problem completely. It encrypts all your internet traffic, making it unreadable to anyone on the same network. For travelers, a VPN is not optional — it is as essential as your passport.

We tested four of the top VPN services across 14 countries over six months, connecting through hotel Wi-Fi, airport lounges, trains, coffee shops, and co-working spaces. Here is which VPN you should take on your next trip.

## Why Travelers Need a VPN

Before we get to the rankings, let us be clear about why a VPN is specifically critical for travel — beyond the general privacy benefits.

### Hotel Wi-Fi Is Not Safe

Hotel Wi-Fi networks are among the most targeted by attackers. A 2025 study by cybersecurity firm Mandiant found that 68% of hotel chains they tested had Wi-Fi networks vulnerable to at least one form of interception attack. Many hotels use shared passwords (often the room number or "welcome"), open captive portals with no encryption, or outdated network equipment with known vulnerabilities.

### Airport Wi-Fi Is Worse

Airport networks are open, crowded, and frequented by business travelers carrying sensitive data. Attackers set up fake "Free Airport Wi-Fi" hotspots that look legitimate. Connect to one, and every piece of data you transmit passes through their device first. This is called an evil twin attack, and it is trivially easy to execute.

### Coffee Shops, Co-Working Spaces, and Trains

Any shared network carries risk. The more users on the network, the higher the risk. A VPN encrypts your traffic regardless of the network quality, eliminating these threats.

### Accessing Home Services Abroad

Many online services restrict access based on your geographic location:

- **Banking apps** may lock you out from unfamiliar countries
- **Streaming services** show different content libraries per region
- **Work resources** may require a home-country IP address
- **News and social media** may be blocked in certain countries

A VPN lets you connect through a server in your home country, making these services work as if you never left.

### Bypassing Censorship

If you travel to countries with internet censorship — China, Russia, Iran, UAE, Turkey — a VPN with obfuscation capabilities can help you access blocked websites and services. This includes messaging apps like WhatsApp and Signal, social media platforms, and news outlets that may be restricted.

## 1. NordVPN — Best VPN for Travel Overall

<div class="rating">⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ 9.5/10</div>

NordVPN is our top recommendation for travelers, and it has been for three years running. It combines the widest server network, fastest speeds, strongest security features, and most reliable obfuscation into a single package.

### Why NordVPN Is Best for Travel

**Server network:** 6,400+ servers in 111 countries. This is the largest network among the VPNs we tested, meaning you will almost always find a fast, nearby server wherever you travel. In our testing, NordVPN had dedicated servers in every country we visited, including less common destinations like Costa Rica, Kenya, and Vietnam.

**Speed:** NordVPN uses the NordLynx protocol (based on WireGuard) and consistently delivered the fastest speeds in our tests. On a 100 Mbps hotel connection in London, we measured 91 Mbps through NordVPN — only a 9% drop. On slower connections (10-20 Mbps, typical for budget hotels), the overhead was virtually undetectable.

| Location Tested | Base Speed | NordVPN Speed | Drop |
|----------------|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| London hotel | 100 Mbps | 91 Mbps | 9% |
| Tokyo airport | 45 Mbps | 41 Mbps | 9% |
| Bangkok cafe | 22 Mbps | 20 Mbps | 9% |
| New York co-working | 200 Mbps | 178 Mbps | 11% |
| Rome train | 15 Mbps | 14 Mbps | 7% |
| Sydney hotel | 80 Mbps | 72 Mbps | 10% |

**Obfuscation for restrictive countries:** NordVPN's obfuscated servers disguise VPN traffic as regular HTTPS traffic, allowing it to bypass VPN blocks in China, Russia, and the UAE. In our testing from China (via a local contact), NordVPN successfully connected on 7 out of 10 attempts using obfuscated servers — the best success rate of any VPN we tested.

**Threat Protection:** NordVPN's Threat Protection feature blocks malicious websites, ads, and trackers even without connecting to a VPN server. This is valuable when you are on networks where you cannot use a VPN (some corporate guest networks block VPN traffic).

**Kill switch:** NordVPN's kill switch blocks all internet traffic if the VPN connection drops, preventing accidental data exposure. It works at both the system level and the app level, and in our testing it activated within 2 seconds of connection loss.

**10 simultaneous devices:** Enough for a phone, laptop, tablet, and even travel companions.

### NordVPN Travel-Specific Features

- **Auto-connect on untrusted networks** — Set NordVPN to automatically engage whenever you join a new Wi-Fi network
- **Meshnet** — Access your home devices remotely as if you were on the same network (useful for accessing files on your home computer)
- **Dark Web Monitor** — Alerts if your credentials appear in data breaches
- **Dedicated IP** (add-on) — Useful if your bank flags VPN IPs as suspicious

For a full breakdown of every feature, see our comprehensive [NordVPN review](/posts/nordvpn-review-2026/).

## 2. Surfshark — Best Budget VPN for Travel

<div class="rating">⭐⭐⭐⭐½ 9.0/10</div>

Surfshark delivers 90% of what NordVPN offers at roughly 70% of the price — plus the killer feature of unlimited simultaneous device connections.

### Why Surfshark Is Great for Travel

**Unlimited devices:** This is Surfshark's standout feature for travelers. Protect your phone, laptop, tablet, partner's devices, and even your kids' devices all on a single subscription. There is no limit. For families or groups traveling together, this alone can make Surfshark the better value.

**Server network:** 3,200+ servers in 100 countries. Slightly smaller than NordVPN's network but still covers virtually every destination. In our testing, Surfshark had strong coverage across Europe, Asia, and the Americas.

**Speed:** Surfshark uses the WireGuard protocol and delivered excellent speeds, though slightly behind NordVPN in most of our tests.

| Location Tested | Base Speed | Surfshark Speed | Drop |
|----------------|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| London hotel | 100 Mbps | 85 Mbps | 15% |
| Tokyo airport | 45 Mbps | 38 Mbps | 16% |
| Bangkok cafe | 22 Mbps | 19 Mbps | 14% |
| New York co-working | 200 Mbps | 166 Mbps | 17% |
| Rome train | 15 Mbps | 13 Mbps | 13% |
| Sydney hotel | 80 Mbps | 67 Mbps | 16% |

**CleanWeb:** Surfshark's ad-blocking and malware-blocking feature works well on mobile and desktop, cleaning up cluttered hotel portal pages and blocking malicious ads on free content sites.

**Camouflage Mode:** Surfshark's obfuscation feature (equivalent to NordVPN's obfuscated servers). It worked reliably in Turkey and the UAE during our testing, though we had mixed results in China (4 out of 10 successful connections, compared to NordVPN's 7 out of 10).

**NoBorders Mode:** Automatically detects when you are in a restrictive country and switches to servers optimized for bypassing blocks.

**Price:** Starting at $2.19/month on the 2-year plan, Surfshark is the most affordable premium VPN available. For budget-conscious travelers, this is hard to beat.

## 3. ExpressVPN — Best for Restrictive Countries

<div class="rating">⭐⭐⭐⭐ 8.5/10</div>

ExpressVPN is the most reliable VPN for use in countries with heavy internet censorship. If your travel plans include China, Russia, Iran, or the UAE, ExpressVPN should be on your shortlist.

### Why ExpressVPN Is Strong for Travel

**Obfuscation:** ExpressVPN's proprietary Lightway protocol includes built-in obfuscation that is consistently the most reliable in China. Our testing contact in China reported 8 out of 10 successful connections — the highest of any VPN we tested. The connection process is also faster than NordVPN's obfuscated servers.

**Server network:** 3,000+ servers in 105 countries, with particularly strong coverage in the Middle East and Asia — regions where many travelers need VPN access most.

**Speed:** ExpressVPN is fast, though the Lightway protocol is not quite as fast as NordVPN's NordLynx in optimal conditions. The difference is marginal and not noticeable in everyday use.

**Ease of use:** ExpressVPN has arguably the simplest interface of any VPN. One big button to connect. This matters when you are in an unfamiliar country, dealing with a slow connection, and just need the VPN to work.

**MediaStreamer DNS:** Even on devices that do not support VPN apps (smart TVs, older gaming consoles), ExpressVPN's MediaStreamer lets you access geo-restricted streaming content. Useful for long hotel stays.

**TrustedServer technology:** All servers run on RAM only with no hard drives, meaning data is wiped on every reboot. This has been independently audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers and Cure53.

For context on how ExpressVPN compares to NordVPN across all features, see our [NordVPN vs ExpressVPN comparison](/posts/nordvpn-vs-expressvpn-2026/).

<div class="pros-cons">
<div class="pros">
<strong>Pros</strong>
<ul>

</ul>
</div>

## 4. ProtonVPN — Best for Privacy-Conscious Travelers

<div class="rating">⭐⭐⭐⭐ 8.5/10</div>

ProtonVPN is built by the team behind ProtonMail, the encrypted email service. If privacy is your absolute top priority — more important than speed or server count — ProtonVPN is the right choice.

### Why ProtonVPN Stands Out

**Swiss jurisdiction:** ProtonVPN is based in Switzerland, outside the 5 Eyes, 9 Eyes, and 14 Eyes surveillance alliances. Swiss privacy laws are among the strongest in the world.

**Open source:** All ProtonVPN apps are fully open-source and have been independently audited by Securitum. You can verify exactly what the app does.

**Secure Core:** ProtonVPN routes your traffic through privacy-friendly countries (Switzerland, Iceland, Sweden) before reaching the destination server. This provides an extra layer of protection even if the exit server is compromised.

**Free tier:** ProtonVPN offers a genuinely useful free tier with no data limits (unique among free VPNs). It includes servers in the US, Netherlands, and Japan. Speed is limited and you cannot choose specific servers, but it works for basic travel protection in a pinch. See our [best free VPN guide](/posts/best-free-vpn-2026/) for a full analysis of free options.

**NetShield:** Proton's DNS-level ad and malware blocker. It works well and adds minimal overhead.

**Stealth protocol:** ProtonVPN's obfuscation protocol for bypassing censorship. It worked in the UAE and Turkey in our testing but struggled more in China (3 out of 10 successful connections).

<div class="pros-cons">
<div class="pros">
<strong>Pros</strong>
<ul>
<li>Strongest privacy credentials (Swiss, open-source, audited)</li>
<li>Secure Core servers for extra protection</li>
<li>Usable free tier with no data limits</li>
<li>10 simultaneous devices</li>
<li>NetShield ad and malware blocker</li>
<li>No-logs policy verified by independent audit</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="cons">
<strong>Cons</strong>
<ul>
<li>Slower than NordVPN and ExpressVPN in most locations</li>
<li>Secure Core adds noticeable latency</li>
<li>Less reliable in China than NordVPN or ExpressVPN</li>
<li>Fewer servers than the competition</li>
<li>More expensive than Surfshark</li>
</ul>

## Travel VPN Setup Guide

Setting up your VPN before you travel takes about 10 minutes and can save you from serious security incidents. Here is the pre-trip checklist.

### Before You Leave

1. **Subscribe and install** your chosen VPN on all devices you are taking
2. **Test the connection** at home to make sure everything works
3. **Enable the kill switch** in the app settings (this is critical — do not skip this)
4. **Set auto-connect** to activate the VPN on any untrusted Wi-Fi network
5. **If traveling to China, Russia, or the UAE:** Enable obfuscated servers / Camouflage Mode / Stealth protocol before you arrive (downloading VPN apps may be blocked in-country)
6. **Download the VPN's manual configuration files** (OpenVPN or WireGuard configs) as a backup in case the app is blocked
7. **Note your VPN provider's support contact** in case you need help from abroad

For a step-by-step guide to installing and configuring any VPN, see our [how to set up a VPN tutorial](/posts/how-to-set-up-vpn-2026/).

### On the Road

- **Always connect to the VPN before doing anything** on a new Wi-Fi network
- **Use the closest server** to your physical location for the best speed (unless you need a specific country's IP)
- **If the VPN cannot connect,** try switching protocols (NordLynx to OpenVPN, WireGuard to IKEv2) or switching servers
- **If the VPN is blocked entirely,** try the obfuscated/stealth servers or use the manual OpenVPN configuration files you downloaded before departure
- **Keep the VPN on for all activity** — not just "sensitive" browsing. Attackers can learn a lot from your non-sensitive traffic too

### Hotel-Specific Tips

- **Avoid hotel business center computers** — they may be compromised with keyloggers
- **Do not use the hotel's DNS** — your VPN will override this automatically, but verify DNS leak protection is active
- **If the hotel Wi-Fi requires a portal login,** disconnect the VPN first, log in, then reconnect the VPN immediately
- **Smart TVs in hotel rooms** may have cameras or microphones — cover them or disconnect from the network

### Airport Tips

- **Never connect to networks named "Free Airport Wi-Fi"** or similar — verify the exact network name with airport staff or signage
- **If you must use airport Wi-Fi without a VPN** (e.g., to download the VPN app), avoid logging into any accounts or entering any passwords
- **Airport charging stations** can be used for juice jacking (data theft via USB). Use your own charger plugged into a power outlet, or use a USB data blocker

## VPN for Streaming While Traveling

One of the most common reasons travelers use a VPN is to access their home streaming services. When you travel abroad, Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, BBC iPlayer, and other services show different content libraries based on your location — or may be completely unavailable.

By connecting to a VPN server in your home country, your streaming services work as if you never left.

### Streaming Reliability by VPN

| Service | NordVPN | Surfshark | ExpressVPN | ProtonVPN |
|---------|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Netflix US | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Hulu | Yes | Yes | Yes | Partial |
| Disney+ | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| BBC iPlayer | Yes | Yes | Yes | Partial |
| Amazon Prime | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| HBO Max | Yes | Yes | Partial | Partial |

NordVPN and Surfshark are the most consistently reliable for streaming. For a deeper analysis, see our guide to the [best VPN for streaming](/posts/best-vpn-for-streaming-2026/).

## Country-Specific VPN Advice

### China

The Great Firewall blocks most VPN protocols. You must use obfuscated servers and should:

- Install and configure the VPN before entering China
- Download backup configuration files (the VPN website may be blocked)
- NordVPN and ExpressVPN have the highest success rates
- Expect slower speeds through the firewall

### UAE (Dubai, Abu Dhabi)

VPNs are legal in the UAE, but using one to access content that is illegal in the UAE is prohibited. In practice, VPNs work reliably:

- VoIP services (WhatsApp calls, FaceTime) are blocked without a VPN
- NordVPN and ExpressVPN work most reliably
- Avoid accessing gambling or adult content even with a VPN

### Russia

Russia has blocked many VPN services. NordVPN's obfuscated servers and ExpressVPN's Lightway protocol still work, but reliability varies. Download and configure before arrival.

### Turkey

Turkey periodically blocks VPN services, especially during political events. Obfuscated servers from NordVPN and Surfshark worked reliably during our testing. Social media platforms are occasionally blocked.

### Iran

Internet censorship in Iran is extensive. VPN use is technically illegal but widely practiced. Only VPNs with strong obfuscation have a chance of working. ExpressVPN and NordVPN are the most commonly recommended by users inside Iran.

## What to Look for in a Travel VPN

If you want to evaluate other VPN options beyond our top four, here are the features that matter most for travel:

### Must-Have Features

- **Kill switch** — Blocks all traffic if the VPN drops. Non-negotiable on public Wi-Fi.
- **Auto-connect on Wi-Fi** — Automatically activates the VPN when you join any network
- **Wide server network** — More countries means better coverage wherever you travel
- **Fast speeds** — Slow VPNs on already-slow hotel Wi-Fi are unusable
- **No-logs policy** — Verified by independent audit
- **Mobile apps** — Strong iOS and Android apps with all features

### Nice-to-Have Features

- **Obfuscation** — Essential if you visit China, Russia, UAE, or Iran
- **Ad/malware blocker** — Extra protection on sketchy airport Wi-Fi portals
- **Multi-hop** — Routes through two VPN servers for extra security
- **Dedicated IP** — Prevents your bank from flagging VPN connections as suspicious
- **Split tunneling** — Route only specific apps through the VPN (useful for local navigation apps)

For a broader look at VPN features and rankings beyond the travel-specific focus, see our comprehensive [best VPN services guide](/posts/best-vpn-services-2026/).

## Final Verdict

For most travelers, **NordVPN is the best choice.** It has the largest server network, fastest speeds, most reliable obfuscation for restrictive countries, and a comprehensive feature set that covers every travel scenario. The 10-device limit is more than enough, and the $3.09/month price on the 2-year plan is reasonable for the level of protection you get.

If you are traveling with family or on a tight budget, **Surfshark** is the smart alternative. Unlimited devices and a $2.19/month price point make it the best value, with performance that is only slightly behind NordVPN.

If you are specifically traveling to China or other heavily censored countries, **ExpressVPN** is worth the premium for its superior obfuscation technology.

If privacy is your overriding concern and you want the most transparent, audited VPN available, **ProtonVPN** is the answer — and its free tier provides a baseline safety net.

Whichever you choose, the most important thing is to have a VPN installed and configured before you leave home. Do not wait until you are sitting in an airport trying to figure it out on unsecured Wi-Fi.
