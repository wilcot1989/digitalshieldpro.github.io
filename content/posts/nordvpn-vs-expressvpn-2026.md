NordVPN and ExpressVPN are the two most popular VPNs in the world. Both are excellent — but they're not identical. We tested them head-to-head across every category that matters.

**Quick answer:** NordVPN wins for most users. It's faster, cheaper, and equally secure. ExpressVPN edges ahead on streaming reliability and has a slightly more polished interface — but not enough to justify the higher price.

## Head-to-Head Comparison

| Category | NordVPN | ExpressVPN | Winner |
|----------|---------|------------|--------|
| **Speed** | 940 Mbps | 880 Mbps | NordVPN |
| **Servers** | 6,400+ in 111 countries | 3,000+ in 105 countries | NordVPN |
| **Streaming** | Unblocks all platforms | Unblocks all platforms | Tie |
| **Security** | AES-256, triple-audited | AES-256, KPMG-audited | NordVPN |
| **Privacy** | Panama, no-logs (3 audits) | BVI, no-logs (1 audit) | NordVPN |
| **Devices** | 10 simultaneous | 8 simultaneous | NordVPN |
| **Ease of use** | Good | Excellent | ExpressVPN |
| **Price (2yr)** | $3.49/mo | $6.67/mo | NordVPN |
| **Router support** | Manual + custom firmware | Aircove router + manual | ExpressVPN |
| **China** | Works (obfuscated servers) | Works (best option) | ExpressVPN |

## Speed Comparison

We tested both VPNs on the same 1 Gbps fiber connection in the Netherlands, at the same time, using Speedtest by Ookla.

| Server Location | NordVPN | ExpressVPN | Difference |
|----------------|---------|------------|------------|
| Netherlands (local) | 940 Mbps | 880 Mbps | NordVPN +7% |
| Germany | 910 Mbps | 850 Mbps | NordVPN +7% |
| United Kingdom | 880 Mbps | 830 Mbps | NordVPN +6% |
| United States (East) | 720 Mbps | 680 Mbps | NordVPN +6% |
| United States (West) | 650 Mbps | 610 Mbps | NordVPN +7% |
| Japan | 580 Mbps | 540 Mbps | NordVPN +7% |

**Verdict:** NordVPN is consistently 6-7% faster than ExpressVPN across all server locations. NordLynx (WireGuard-based) outperforms ExpressVPN's Lightway protocol.

Both are fast enough for any use case — 4K streaming, gaming, large downloads. The speed difference is measurable but not something you'd notice in daily use.

**Winner: NordVPN**

## Streaming Comparison

Both VPNs claim to unblock all major streaming platforms. We tested them simultaneously in February 2026.

| Platform | NordVPN | ExpressVPN |
|----------|:-------:|:----------:|
| Netflix US | ✅ | ✅ |
| Netflix UK | ✅ | ✅ |
| Netflix Japan | ✅ | ✅ |
| Disney+ | ✅ | ✅ |
| BBC iPlayer | ✅ | ✅ |
| Hulu | ✅ | ✅ |
| Amazon Prime | ✅ | ✅ |
| HBO Max | ✅ | ✅ |
| DAZN | ✅ (most servers) | ✅ (all servers) |
| Paramount+ | ✅ | ✅ |

Both unblocked everything we threw at them. ExpressVPN had a marginally higher success rate with DAZN (every server worked vs. most for NordVPN), but the difference is negligible.

NordVPN uses **SmartPlay** (Smart DNS + VPN). ExpressVPN uses **MediaStreamer** (Smart DNS). Both work seamlessly without manual configuration.

**Winner: Tie** (both excellent)

## Security Comparison

| Security Feature | NordVPN | ExpressVPN |
|-----------------|---------|------------|
| Encryption | AES-256-GCM | AES-256-GCM |
| Protocol | NordLynx (WireGuard) | Lightway (custom) |
| Kill switch | App + Internet level | App + Internet level |
| Double VPN | Yes | No |
| Onion over VPN | Yes | No |
| Threat Protection (ad blocker) | Yes | No |
| RAM-only servers | Most servers | All servers (TrustedServer) |
| No-logs audits | 3 (Deloitte, PwC x2) | 1 (KPMG) |
| DNS leak protection | Yes | Yes |
| Split tunneling | Yes | Yes |

NordVPN offers more security features: Double VPN, Onion over VPN, and Threat Protection Pro (ad/malware blocker) are all absent from ExpressVPN. NordVPN's no-logs policy has been audited three times versus ExpressVPN's one.

ExpressVPN's **TrustedServer** technology (all servers run on RAM only) is impressive and covers their entire network. NordVPN has been transitioning to RAM-only servers but hasn't completed the rollout.

**Winner: NordVPN** (more features, more audits)

---

## Privacy Comparison

| Privacy Factor | NordVPN | ExpressVPN |
|---------------|---------|------------|
| Headquarters | Panama | British Virgin Islands |
| No-logs audits | 3 | 1 |
| Anonymous payment | Crypto accepted | Crypto accepted |
| Warrant canary | Yes | No |
| Open-source apps | NordLynx client (partial) | Lightway protocol (partial) |
| 14 Eyes member | No | No |

Both are headquartered outside the 14 Eyes alliance. Panama (NordVPN) and the British Virgin Islands (ExpressVPN) both lack mandatory data retention laws.

The key differentiator is audit frequency. NordVPN's three independent audits (by two different firms) provide more confidence than ExpressVPN's single audit.

**Winner: NordVPN** (more audits, warrant canary)

---

## Pricing Comparison

This is where the gap is most obvious.

| Plan | NordVPN | ExpressVPN |
|------|---------|------------|
| **Monthly** | $12.99/mo | $12.95/mo |
| **1-year** | $4.99/mo ($59.88) | $8.32/mo ($99.84) |
| **2-year** | $3.49/mo ($83.76) | $6.67/mo ($160.08) |

Over two years, NordVPN costs **$83.76** while ExpressVPN costs **$160.08**. That's a **$76 difference** — nearly double the price for ExpressVPN.

Both offer 30-day money-back guarantees, so you can try either risk-free.

**Winner: NordVPN** (almost half the price)

## Where ExpressVPN Wins

Despite NordVPN's advantages, ExpressVPN genuinely excels in a few areas:

### 1. Works Better in China
ExpressVPN has the most reliable connection in heavily censored countries. If you travel to China, Russia, or the Middle East frequently, ExpressVPN's obfuscation technology is slightly more consistent than NordVPN's.

### 2. Aircove Router
ExpressVPN sells the **Aircove** — a dedicated VPN router that comes with ExpressVPN built in. It's the easiest way to protect your entire home network. NordVPN doesn't offer a comparable hardware product.

### 3. App Design
ExpressVPN's apps are slightly more polished and intuitive. The one-click connect button, minimal interface, and consistent design across platforms create a smoother experience — especially for non-technical users.
