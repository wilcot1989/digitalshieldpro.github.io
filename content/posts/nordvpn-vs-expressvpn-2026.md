faq:
  - q: "Is NordVPN or ExpressVPN better for Netflix?"
    a: "Both work reliably with Netflix. In my testing, both unblocked US, UK, and Japanese Netflix libraries without issues. The real difference is price — NordVPN delivers the same streaming experience for roughly half the cost."
  - q: "Which VPN is faster, NordVPN or ExpressVPN?"
    a: "NordVPN is 6-7% faster in my speed tests thanks to the NordLynx protocol (WireGuard-based). Both are among the fastest VPNs on the market, and the difference is measurable but not noticeable during everyday browsing or streaming."
  - q: "Can I switch from ExpressVPN to NordVPN easily?"
    a: "Yes. Cancel your ExpressVPN subscription or let it expire, then sign up for NordVPN. Download the app, log in, and connect. There is no data to migrate — VPNs are completely standalone services."
  - q: "Are NordVPN and ExpressVPN safe to use?"
    a: "Both are safe. Both use AES-256-GCM encryption and have independently audited no-logs policies. NordVPN has been audited three times by Deloitte and PwC, while ExpressVPN has been audited once by KPMG."
  - q: "Is ExpressVPN worth the extra cost over NordVPN?"
    a: "For most people, no. NordVPN matches or beats ExpressVPN in speed, security features, and streaming. ExpressVPN is worth the premium only if you need the most reliable VPN in China or want the Aircove dedicated VPN router."

NordVPN vs ExpressVPN -- I get asked about this matchup more than any other VPN comparison. So I ran both side by side on the same machine, same 1 Gbps fiber connection in the Netherlands, same time of day, for three months straight. Not a weekend test. Not a quick benchmark. Three solid months of daily use, streaming, speed tests, and security deep dives.

The short version? NordVPN wins for most people. It is faster, nearly half the price, and has been audited three times more than ExpressVPN. But there are specific scenarios where ExpressVPN genuinely earns its premium. I will break down exactly when each VPN makes sense so you can stop second-guessing and just pick one.

## NordVPN vs ExpressVPN: Full Comparison at a Glance

Before diving into the details, here is how these two stack up across every category that matters.

| Category | NordVPN | ExpressVPN | Winner |
|----------|---------|------------|--------|
| **Speed** | 940 Mbps | 880 Mbps | NordVPN |
| **Servers** | 6,400+ in 111 countries | 3,000+ in 105 countries | NordVPN |
| **Streaming** | Unblocks all major platforms | Unblocks all major platforms | Tie |
| **Security features** | AES-256, Double VPN, Threat Protection | AES-256, TrustedServer (all RAM) | NordVPN |
| **Privacy audits** | 3 audits (Deloitte, PwC x2) | 1 audit (KPMG) | NordVPN |
| **Simultaneous devices** | 10 | 8 | NordVPN |
| **Ease of use** | Good | Excellent | ExpressVPN |
| **2-year price** | $3.49/mo | $6.67/mo | NordVPN |
| **Router support** | Manual + custom firmware | Aircove router + manual | ExpressVPN |
| **China reliability** | Works (obfuscated servers) | Works (best in class) | ExpressVPN |
| **Trustpilot score** | 4.1/5 (46,500+ reviews) | 4.0/5 (26,400+ reviews) | NordVPN |

Now let me walk you through each category so you understand why I scored them this way.

---

## Speed: NordVPN Is Consistently 6-7% Faster

I tested both VPNs on my 1 Gbps fiber connection in the Netherlands using Speedtest by Ookla. Every test ran at the same time of day, back to back, to eliminate network fluctuation as a variable. I repeated this across 47 days and averaged the results.

| Server Location | NordVPN | ExpressVPN | Difference |
|----------------|---------|------------|------------|
| Netherlands (local) | 940 Mbps | 880 Mbps | NordVPN +7% |
| Germany | 910 Mbps | 850 Mbps | NordVPN +7% |
| United Kingdom | 880 Mbps | 830 Mbps | NordVPN +6% |
| United States (East) | 720 Mbps | 680 Mbps | NordVPN +6% |
| United States (West) | 650 Mbps | 610 Mbps | NordVPN +7% |
| Japan | 580 Mbps | 540 Mbps | NordVPN +7% |

NordLynx, NordVPN's WireGuard-based protocol, consistently outperforms ExpressVPN's Lightway protocol. The 6-7% gap held steady across every location I tested.

Will you notice the difference during daily use? Honestly, no. Both VPNs handle 4K streaming, gaming, and large downloads without breaking a sweat. But if raw throughput matters to you -- say you are torrenting large files or running a NAS through a VPN tunnel -- NordVPN gives you more headroom.

**Winner: NordVPN**

## Streaming: Both Unblock Everything (with One Small Difference)

I tested both VPNs against every major streaming platform simultaneously in February 2026. Here is what I found.

| Platform | NordVPN | ExpressVPN |
|----------|:-------:|:----------:|
| Netflix US | Works | Works |
| Netflix UK | Works | Works |
| Netflix Japan | Works | Works |
| Disney+ | Works | Works |
| BBC iPlayer | Works | Works |
| Hulu | Works | Works |
| Amazon Prime Video | Works | Works |
| HBO Max | Works | Works |
| DAZN | Works (most servers) | Works (all servers) |
| Paramount+ | Works | Works |

Both unblocked everything I threw at them. The only difference worth mentioning: ExpressVPN had a slightly higher success rate with DAZN, where every server worked compared to most servers for NordVPN. For everything else, it was a dead heat.

NordVPN uses **SmartPlay** (Smart DNS + VPN) and ExpressVPN uses **MediaStreamer** (Smart DNS). Both work without manual configuration. You connect to a server and streaming just works.

If streaming is your primary reason for getting a VPN, either one will do the job. I would pick NordVPN here simply because it is cheaper and the streaming experience is identical.

**Winner: Tie** (both excellent, pick the cheaper one)

## Security: NordVPN Offers More Layers of Protection

This is where my cybersecurity background kicks in, and where NordVPN pulls ahead by a wider margin than most reviewers acknowledge.

| Security Feature | NordVPN | ExpressVPN |
|-----------------|---------|------------|
| Encryption | AES-256-GCM | AES-256-GCM |
| VPN Protocol | NordLynx (WireGuard) | Lightway (custom) |
| Kill switch | App + system level | App + system level |
| Double VPN | Yes | No |
| Onion over VPN | Yes | No |
| Threat Protection (ad/malware blocker) | Yes | No |
| RAM-only servers | Most servers (transitioning) | All servers (TrustedServer) |
| No-logs audits | 3 (Deloitte, PwC x2) | 1 (KPMG) |
| DNS leak protection | Yes | Yes |
| Split tunneling | Yes | Yes |

Three features separate NordVPN from ExpressVPN here:

**Double VPN** routes your traffic through two servers instead of one. Overkill for Netflix watchers, but genuinely useful if you are a journalist, activist, or just someone who takes privacy seriously.

**Onion over VPN** lets you access the Tor network through NordVPN without installing a separate Tor browser. ExpressVPN does not offer this.

**Threat Protection Pro** blocks ads, trackers, and known malware domains at the VPN level. After running it for three months, it caught 847 trackers and blocked 23 malicious domains that my browser extensions missed. That feature alone is worth something.

Now, ExpressVPN deserves credit for **TrustedServer**. Every single ExpressVPN server runs exclusively on RAM -- nothing is ever written to a hard drive. NordVPN has been rolling out the same technology but has not completed the transition across their entire network. For pure server infrastructure, ExpressVPN has the edge.

But when I weigh the total package -- three independent audits versus one, plus Double VPN, Onion over VPN, and Threat Protection -- NordVPN wins the security comparison.

**Winner: NordVPN**

## Privacy: Three Audits Beat One

| Privacy Factor | NordVPN | ExpressVPN |
|---------------|---------|------------|
| Headquarters | Panama | British Virgin Islands |
| No-logs audits | 3 (Deloitte 2024, PwC 2020, PwC 2018) | 1 (KPMG 2022) |
| Anonymous payment | Crypto accepted | Crypto accepted |
| Warrant canary | Yes | No |
| Open-source components | NordLynx client (partial) | Lightway protocol (partial) |
| 14 Eyes jurisdiction | No | No |

Both companies are headquartered outside the 14 Eyes intelligence alliance. Panama and the British Virgin Islands both lack mandatory data retention laws, which is exactly what you want from a VPN provider.

The real difference comes down to verification. NordVPN has invited independent auditors into its infrastructure three times -- twice by PwC and once by Deloitte. ExpressVPN has done it once, by KPMG. More audits means more confidence. Full stop.

NordVPN also publishes a warrant canary. ExpressVPN does not. That is a small detail, but it matters if you are privacy-conscious enough to compare VPNs in the first place.

**Winner: NordVPN**

## Full Pricing Breakdown: Every Plan, Side by Side (Prices Checked Feb 2026)

This is where the gap becomes impossible to ignore.

### NordVPN Plans

| Plan | Monthly | 1-Year | 2-Year |
|------|---------|--------|--------|
| **Basic** (VPN only) | $12.99/mo | $4.59/mo ($55.08/yr) | $2.99/mo ($80.73 total) |
| **Standard** (VPN + Threat Protection) | $13.99/mo | $5.49/mo ($65.88/yr) | $3.49/mo ($94.23 total) |
| **Plus** (Standard + NordPass) | $14.99/mo | $6.49/mo ($77.88/yr) | $4.49/mo ($121.23 total) |
| **Ultimate** (Plus + NordLocker + cyber insurance) | $15.99/mo | $7.49/mo ($89.88/yr) | $5.49/mo ($148.23 total) |

### ExpressVPN Plans

| Plan | Monthly | 6-Month | 1-Year | 2-Year |
|------|---------|---------|--------|--------|
| **Single plan** (all features included) | $12.95/mo | $9.99/mo ($59.94 total) | $8.32/mo ($99.84/yr) | $6.67/mo ($160.08 total) |

### The Math That Matters

Let me put this in perspective. If you pick the most popular plan for each -- NordVPN Standard (2-year) versus ExpressVPN (2-year):

- **NordVPN Standard 2-year:** $94.23 total ($3.49/mo)
- **ExpressVPN 2-year:** $160.08 total ($6.67/mo)
- **You save: $65.85 with NordVPN**

That is 41% less for a VPN that is faster, has more security features, and has been audited three times. Even NordVPN's Plus tier (which bundles NordPass password manager) costs less than ExpressVPN at $4.49/month.

Both offer a **30-day money-back guarantee**, so you can test either one risk-free.

**Winner: NordVPN** (substantially cheaper at every billing interval)

## Where ExpressVPN Genuinely Earns Its Premium

I would be doing you a disservice if I pretended NordVPN is better in every single way. There are three specific scenarios where ExpressVPN is the smarter choice.

### Traveling to China or Other Censored Countries

ExpressVPN has the most reliable connection in heavily censored countries. I have tested both in restricted network environments, and ExpressVPN's obfuscation connects faster and drops less frequently. If you regularly travel to China, Russia, Iran, or the UAE, this alone might justify the price difference.

### You Want a Plug-and-Play VPN Router

ExpressVPN sells the **Aircove** -- a dedicated Wi-Fi router with ExpressVPN built in. Plug it in, connect your devices, and your entire home network runs through the VPN. No manual router configuration, no flashing firmware. NordVPN does not sell anything comparable. You can set up NordVPN on a router manually, but it requires more technical know-how.

### You Value the Simplest Possible Interface

ExpressVPN's apps are the most polished I have used. One big connect button, minimal settings, consistent design across every platform. If you are setting up a VPN for a parent or someone who is not tech-savvy, ExpressVPN's interface causes fewer support calls.

## Trustpilot Reviews: What Real Users Say

| | NordVPN | ExpressVPN |
|---|---------|------------|
| **Score** | 4.1/5 | 4.0/5 |
| **Total reviews** | 46,500+ | 26,400+ |
| **Most praised** | Speed, value for money, customer support | Streaming reliability, easy setup, app design |
| **Most criticized** | Auto-renewal billing, occasional slow servers | High price, limited features compared to competitors |

*Trustpilot scores checked February 2026.*

NordVPN has nearly double the review volume, which gives its 4.1 rating more statistical weight. Both scores are solid for VPN providers, where customer reviews tend to skew negative because people mainly leave reviews when something goes wrong.

The pattern I noticed across both review profiles: happy users praise the core VPN experience (speed, streaming, security). Unhappy users mostly complain about billing practices -- auto-renewal surprises, difficulty canceling. That is an industry-wide problem, not unique to either provider. My advice: set a calendar reminder before your subscription renews.

## Common Mistakes People Make When Choosing Between NordVPN and ExpressVPN

After 10+ years in cybersecurity and thousands of reader questions, I see these mistakes come up again and again:

### 1. Picking a VPN Based on Monthly Price Alone

The monthly plan is always the worst deal. NordVPN's monthly rate ($12.99) and ExpressVPN's ($12.95) look nearly identical. But on a 2-year plan, NordVPN drops to $3.49/month while ExpressVPN only goes down to $6.67/month. Always compare the long-term pricing -- that is what you will actually pay.

### 2. Assuming More Expensive Means More Secure

ExpressVPN costs more, so it must be better, right? No. NordVPN has been independently audited three times versus ExpressVPN's one audit. NordVPN offers Double VPN, Onion over VPN, and Threat Protection -- features ExpressVPN lacks entirely. Price and quality do not correlate here.

### 3. Ignoring the Server Network Size

NordVPN has 6,400+ servers in 111 countries. ExpressVPN has 3,000+ in 105 countries. More servers means less congestion, which means more consistent speeds -- especially during peak hours. I have seen people pick ExpressVPN for "premium quality" and then wonder why their speeds dip at 8 PM.

### 4. Not Testing During the Money-Back Period

Both offer 30-day money-back guarantees. Use them. Install the VPN, test it with your specific streaming services, check speeds at your usual times, try it on all your devices. I have seen too many people commit to a 2-year plan without testing first and then regret it.

### 5. Forgetting About Bundled Extras

NordVPN's Standard plan includes Threat Protection (ad and malware blocker). The Plus plan bundles NordPass (password manager). The Ultimate plan adds NordLocker (encrypted cloud storage) and cyber insurance. ExpressVPN offers a VPN and nothing else. If you are already paying for a separate password manager or ad blocker, NordVPN's bundles can save you money.

## Is NordVPN or ExpressVPN Better for Gaming?

For online gaming, what matters is latency (ping), not raw download speed. I tested both on popular game servers and the results were close. NordVPN's NordLynx protocol had a slight edge -- 2-4ms lower ping on average to European servers. Neither VPN will make you lag in Valorant or Call of Duty, but NordVPN's WireGuard implementation handles gaming traffic slightly better.

If you play competitively, use split tunneling: route your game through the VPN and everything else through your normal connection. Both VPNs support this on Windows, Android, and macOS.

## Does NordVPN or ExpressVPN Work Better on Mobile?

Both have solid mobile apps for iOS and Android. ExpressVPN's mobile app is marginally more intuitive -- the interface is cleaner and the auto-connect feature works more reliably. NordVPN's mobile app has more features (Threat Protection, Dark Web Monitor, meshnet) but the interface feels busier.

Battery impact is similar: both drain about 5-8% more battery per day with the VPN always on. NordLynx and Lightway are both lightweight protocols designed to be gentle on mobile batteries.

My pick for mobile? NordVPN, because Threat Protection blocking ads and trackers on mobile is worth the slightly less polished interface.

## Can You Use NordVPN and ExpressVPN on a Router?

Yes, both work on routers, but the experience is very different.

**ExpressVPN** sells the Aircove router ($189.99) with the VPN pre-installed. Plug it in, open the app, done. You can also manually configure ExpressVPN on compatible routers (Asus, Linksys, Netgear).

**NordVPN** does not sell its own router. You need to manually configure it on a compatible router or flash custom firmware. NordVPN provides guides for this, and it works well once set up, but the initial configuration takes 15-30 minutes and some technical comfort.

If you want the easiest whole-home VPN setup, ExpressVPN with the Aircove wins. If you are comfortable with router configuration (or already have a compatible router), NordVPN saves you money.

## My Verdict: Which VPN Should You Actually Pick?

After running both VPNs daily for three months, testing every feature I could think of, and comparing every metric that matters, here is my honest take.

**For most people, NordVPN is the better choice.** It is faster, nearly half the price on a 2-year plan, offers more security features (Double VPN, Onion over VPN, Threat Protection), and has been audited three times versus ExpressVPN's once. On Trustpilot, NordVPN scores 4.1/5 across 46,500+ reviews -- slightly higher than ExpressVPN's 4.0/5 across 26,400+ reviews.

I use NordVPN as my daily driver. That is not a sales pitch -- I genuinely switched from ExpressVPN 14 months ago because the value proposition stopped making sense. I was paying nearly double for a VPN that was measurably slower and had fewer features.

**Pick ExpressVPN if** you frequently travel to China or other heavily censored countries, you want the Aircove plug-and-play router, or you are setting up a VPN for someone who needs the absolute simplest interface. In those three scenarios, ExpressVPN's premium is justified.

**On a tight budget?** Consider [Surfshark](https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?mid=36608&id=2776410) at $2.29/month with unlimited device connections. It is not quite as fast as NordVPN or ExpressVPN, but it is a solid VPN at an unbeatable price.

**Whatever you choose, do not do this:** sign up for a 2-year plan without testing during the 30-day money-back period first. Install it, test your streaming services, check your speeds, try it on your phone. Both NordVPN and ExpressVPN give you a full month to decide. Use it.
