faq:
  - q: "What is the best parental control app in 2026?"
    a: "Qustodio is the best overall: it works on all platforms (Windows, Mac, Android, iOS, Chromebook), offers content filtering, screen time management, location tracking, and social media monitoring. For budget-conscious families, Kaspersky Safe Kids offers excellent protection for just €20/year."
  - q: "At what age should I start using parental controls?"
    a: "Start basic controls when your child first uses a device (age 3-5): content filtering and time limits. Increase monitoring as they gain independence (age 8-12): app controls, search filtering, location tracking. For teens (13+), shift toward monitoring tools like Bark that alert you to concerning content rather than blocking everything."
  - q: "Can my teenager bypass parental controls?"
    a: "Determined teenagers can sometimes bypass controls using VPNs, alternative browsers, or factory resets. The best approach combines technical controls with open communication. Tools like Bark focus on monitoring rather than blocking, which is harder to bypass and more appropriate for teens. Regular conversations about online safety are essential."
  - q: "Are free parental control apps good enough?"
    a: "Google Family Link (Android) and Apple Screen Time (iOS) are free and cover the basics: app limits, content filtering, and screen time. They're sufficient for younger children. For comprehensive monitoring (social media, YouTube, messaging apps), paid tools like Qustodio or Bark offer significantly more coverage."
  - q: "Do parental controls work on social media?"
    a: "Most parental controls can't directly monitor within encrypted social media apps (Instagram DMs, Snapchat). Bark is the exception — it uses on-device analysis to detect concerning content in messages, posts, and searches across 30+ platforms without reading the full content. Qustodio monitors social media time and can block specific apps."
  - q: "How do parental controls affect my child's privacy?"
    a: "Balance is key. For young children (under 10), comprehensive monitoring is appropriate and expected. For pre-teens (10-13), gradually reduce monitoring while maintaining safety guardrails. For teens (13+), focus on alert-based monitoring (like Bark) rather than full surveillance. Always be transparent about what you monitor and why."

I set up parental controls for friends and family all the time, and the questions are always the same: will my kid bypass it, does it actually work, and will it spy on them too much? After testing over a dozen apps on real devices with real kids in the loop, I can tell you which ones strike the right balance between safety and age-appropriate freedom.
