faq:
  - q: "How much should a small business spend on cybersecurity?"
    a: "Industry guidance suggests 5-10% of your IT budget, which translates to €100-€500/month for most small businesses. This covers endpoint security (€3-€8/device/month), email security (€2-€5/user/month), backup (€5-€15/month), password manager (€3-€5/user/month), and VPN (€4-€10/month). The cost of a breach averages €120,000 for SMBs."
  - q: "What are the biggest cybersecurity threats to small businesses?"
    a: "The top 5 threats in 2026: (1) Phishing emails (90% of breaches start here), (2) Ransomware (encrypts files, demands payment), (3) Business email compromise (fake invoices from spoofed suppliers), (4) Credential stuffing (stolen passwords reused across accounts), (5) Supply chain attacks (through compromised software or vendors)."
  - q: "Do I need cybersecurity if I'm just a small business?"
    a: "Absolutely. 43% of cyberattacks target small businesses specifically because they're often less protected. A ransomware attack costs SMBs an average of €120,000 in damages, downtime, and recovery. Many small businesses never fully recover from a serious breach. Basic protection costs €100-€200/month."
  - q: "What cybersecurity tools does a small business need?"
    a: "Essential tools: (1) Endpoint security on all devices, (2) Business email security with anti-phishing, (3) Password manager for the team, (4) VPN for remote workers, (5) Automated backup (3-2-1 rule), (6) Multi-factor authentication on all accounts. These cover 90% of threats for under €300/month."
  - q: "How do I train employees on cybersecurity?"
    a: "Start with quarterly 30-minute training sessions covering: spotting phishing emails, password hygiene, safe file sharing, and incident reporting. Use free resources from KnowBe4 or CISA. Run simulated phishing tests monthly. Create a simple security policy document. The human element is the weakest link — training has the highest ROI."
  - q: "Is cyber insurance worth it for small businesses?"
    a: "Yes, especially if you handle customer data, process payments, or would be significantly impacted by downtime. Cyber insurance costs €500-€2,000/year for small businesses and covers breach response costs, legal fees, notification expenses, and business interruption losses. Many policies also include incident response services."

I consult with small businesses on security, and the pattern is always the same: they assume attackers only go after big companies. Then a single phishing email leads to ransomware, and suddenly they are staring at a €120,000 recovery bill. Small businesses are the #1 target precisely because they have valuable data and minimal defenses. The good news is that fixing this does not require an enterprise budget -- here is exactly what to do.

## The Small Business Security Stack

| Layer | Tool | Cost/month | Protects Against |
|-------|------|-----------|-----------------|
| **1. Endpoint Security** | Bitdefender GravityZone / Kaspersky | €3-€8/device | Malware, ransomware, exploits |
| **2. Email Security** | Microsoft 365 / Google Workspace built-in | Included | Phishing, spam, BEC |
| **3. Password Manager** | NordPass Business / 1Password | €3-€5/user | Credential theft, reuse |
| **4. VPN** | NordVPN Teams | €7-€10/user | Data interception, remote work |
| **5. Backup** | Backblaze / Acronis | €5-€15 | Ransomware, data loss |
| **6. MFA** | Google Authenticator (free) | €0 | Account takeover |
| **Total (10 employees)** | | **€150-€350/month** | 90% of threats |

## Step 1: Protect Every Device

Every computer, laptop, and phone that accesses business data needs endpoint protection.

### Recommended: Kaspersky Endpoint Security

<a href="https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?mid=19487&id=2776410" rel="nofollow sponsored" target="_blank">Kaspersky Endpoint Security</a> offers the best protection-to-price ratio for small businesses:
- **€3/device/month** — Most affordable enterprise-grade protection
- **Central management** — Dashboard to manage all devices
- **Auto-updates** — Patches and definitions update automatically
- **Device control** — Block unauthorized USB drives
- **Web filtering** — Block malicious and non-work websites

### What to Enable
1. Real-time protection (always on)
2. Automatic updates (every hour)
3. Full scan (weekly, after hours)
4. Web protection (block malicious sites)
5. Device control (restrict USB)
6. Firewall rules (block unnecessary ports)

## Step 2: Secure Your Email

90% of attacks start with a phishing email. Your email security is your most important defense.

### Essential Email Security Settings
- **SPF, DKIM, DMARC** — Prevent email spoofing of your domain
- **Anti-phishing filters** — Enabled by default in Microsoft 365 and Google Workspace
- **External email warnings** — Flag emails from outside your organization
- **Attachment scanning** — Block dangerous file types (.exe, .scr, .bat)
- **Link scanning** — Check URLs in emails for malicious content

### Employee Training for Phishing
Teach your team the SLAM method:
- **S**ender — Is the sender address legitimate? Check for typos
- **L**inks — Hover before clicking. Does the URL match the expected domain?
- **A**ttachments — Never open unexpected attachments
- **M**essage — Is the tone urgent or threatening? That's a red flag

## Step 3: Passwords and Authentication

### Business Password Manager

<a href="https://go.nordpass.io/aff_c?offer_id=488&aff_id=141337&url_id=32468" rel="nofollow sponsored" target="_blank">NordPass Business</a> gives every employee:
- Unique, generated passwords for every account
- Secure sharing of passwords within teams
- Admin dashboard to enforce password policies
- Breach monitoring for compromised credentials
- **Cost:** €3.99/user/month

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Enable MFA on every business account — it blocks 99.9% of automated attacks.

| Account Type | MFA Method | Priority |
|-------------|-----------|----------|
| Email (Microsoft 365 / Google) | Authenticator app | Critical |
| Banking and financial | Hardware key or app | Critical |
| Cloud storage (Dropbox, Drive) | Authenticator app | High |
| Social media | Authenticator app | High |
| CRM and business tools | Authenticator app | Medium |

## Step 4: Backup Your Data

The 3-2-1 backup rule protects against ransomware, hardware failure, and human error:
- **3** copies of your data
- **2** different storage types (cloud + local)
- **1** copy offsite (cloud backup)

### Backup Strategy
| Data Type | Backup Method | Frequency |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| Documents, email | Cloud sync (OneDrive/Drive) | Real-time |
| Databases, CRM | Automated cloud backup | Daily |
| Full system image | Local NAS + cloud | Weekly |
| Critical files | Version history enabled | Every change |

**Cost:** €5-€15/month for cloud backup (Backblaze, Acronis)

## Step 5: Secure Remote Work

With hybrid and remote work standard, secure your team wherever they work.

### VPN for Business
<a href="https://go.nordvpn.net/aff_c?offer_id=612&aff_id=141337&url_id=25704" rel="nofollow sponsored" target="_blank">NordVPN</a> encrypts all internet traffic, protecting against:
- Data interception on public Wi-Fi
- ISP monitoring of business activities
- Geographic restrictions on business tools

### Remote Work Security Policy
1. Company devices only for business data
2. VPN required on public/home networks
3. Screen lock after 5 minutes of inactivity
4. No saving passwords in browsers
5. Report lost/stolen devices immediately

## Step 6: Create a Security Policy

Every business needs a written security policy, even if it's just one page.

### Essential Sections
1. **Acceptable use** — What employees can/cannot do on company devices
2. **Password requirements** — Minimum 12 characters, unique per account, password manager required
3. **Data handling** — How to handle customer data, financial information
4. **Incident reporting** — What to do if you suspect a breach
5. **Remote work** — VPN, device security, public Wi-Fi rules
6. **Onboarding/offboarding** — Account creation and immediate revocation
