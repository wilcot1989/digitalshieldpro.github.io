faq:
  - q: "What is endpoint security?"
    a: "Endpoint security protects individual devices (laptops, desktops, phones, tablets) that connect to a network. Unlike traditional antivirus, endpoint security includes advanced threat detection (EDR), behavioral analysis, device control, and centralized management. It's essential for businesses with remote workers."
  - q: "What's the difference between antivirus and endpoint security?"
    a: "Traditional antivirus scans files for known malware signatures. Endpoint security goes further with behavioral analysis (detecting unknown threats), EDR (endpoint detection and response), device control, application whitelisting, and centralized management across all devices. Antivirus is a component of endpoint security."
  - q: "Do small businesses need endpoint security?"
    a: "Yes. Small businesses are targeted in 43% of cyberattacks because they often lack proper security. An endpoint security solution with centralized management costs €3-€8 per device per month and protects against ransomware, phishing, and data theft that could otherwise cost thousands."
  - q: "What is EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response)?"
    a: "EDR continuously monitors endpoints for suspicious activity, records detailed event data, and enables investigation and response to threats. When a threat is detected, EDR can isolate the device, kill malicious processes, and roll back changes. It's like having a security camera system for your devices."
  - q: "Can endpoint security protect remote workers?"
    a: "Yes, modern endpoint security is cloud-managed and protects devices regardless of location. Whether your team works from home, a coffee shop, or the office, the endpoint agent provides the same level of protection and reports back to the central dashboard."
  - q: "How much does endpoint security cost?"
    a: "Pricing ranges from €2-€15 per device per month depending on features. Basic endpoint protection (EPP) starts at €2-€5/device/month. Advanced EDR solutions cost €5-€10/device/month. Full XDR (extended detection and response) costs €8-€15/device/month. Most vendors offer volume discounts."

Every device that connects to your network is a potential entry point for attackers. With remote work now standard, your security perimeter isn't your office firewall — it's every laptop, phone, and tablet your team uses.

Endpoint security software protects these devices with advanced threat detection, centralized management, and automated response capabilities that go far beyond traditional antivirus.
