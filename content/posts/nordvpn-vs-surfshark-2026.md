    a: "Get NordVPN if you want the best overall performance, more advanced features, and the strongest security. Get Surfshark if you want the best value, unlimited device connections, or you are on a tight budget. Both are excellent VPNs."
---

NordVPN and Surfshark are owned by the same parent company, so the first question everyone asks me is: are they actually different? After running both on the same hardware, same network, and at the same times for three months, I can confirm they are. NordVPN is faster and more feature-rich; Surfshark is cheaper and offers unlimited device connections. Which one wins depends entirely on what you value most.

## Speed Comparison

Speed is often the deciding factor when choosing a VPN. We ran speed tests on both VPNs using their fastest protocols (NordLynx for NordVPN, WireGuard for Surfshark) on a 1 Gbps fiber connection at multiple times of day.

### Nearby Server Results (Same Country)

| Metric | NordVPN (NordLynx) | Surfshark (WireGuard) |
|--------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Download | 890 Mbps | 840 Mbps |
| Upload | 420 Mbps | 390 Mbps |
| Latency increase | +3 ms | +4 ms |

### Long-Distance Server Results (US to Europe)

| Metric | NordVPN | Surfshark |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| Download | 620 Mbps | 570 Mbps |
| Upload | 280 Mbps | 250 Mbps |
| Latency increase | +85 ms | +92 ms |

### Long-Distance Server Results (US to Asia)

| Metric | NordVPN | Surfshark |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| Download | 410 Mbps | 370 Mbps |
| Upload | 180 Mbps | 160 Mbps |
| Latency increase | +160 ms | +175 ms |

### Speed Consistency Over Time

We did not just test peak speeds. We ran automated speed tests every four hours for 30 days to measure consistency:

- **NordVPN:** Average download speed of 845 Mbps with a standard deviation of 32 Mbps. The lowest recorded speed was 780 Mbps during a Saturday evening peak.
- **Surfshark:** Average download speed of 790 Mbps with a standard deviation of 48 Mbps. The lowest recorded speed was 690 Mbps during peak hours.

NordVPN is not only faster on average but also more consistent. Surfshark has wider speed fluctuations, likely due to its smaller server fleet experiencing more congestion during peak usage periods.

**Winner: NordVPN.** NordLynx consistently outperforms standard WireGuard across all distances and time periods. The difference is most noticeable on long-distance connections where NordVPN maintained 8-11% higher speeds.

For detailed speed results, see our individual reviews: [NordVPN review](/posts/nordvpn-review-2026/) and [Surfshark review](/posts/surfshark-review-2026/).

## Protocol Comparison

Both VPNs support multiple protocols, but their flagship offerings differ.

### NordVPN — NordLynx

NordLynx is NordVPN's proprietary protocol built on the WireGuard codebase. It adds a double NAT system that resolves WireGuard's inherent privacy limitation — the requirement to store a static IP address on the server. This means NordLynx delivers WireGuard-level speed while maintaining a true no-logs environment.

NordVPN also supports:
- OpenVPN (UDP and TCP)
- IKEv2/IPsec (mobile)
- Obfuscated servers for bypassing VPN blocks

### Surfshark — WireGuard

Surfshark uses the standard WireGuard implementation. It is fast and modern, though it lacks the privacy enhancement that NordLynx's double NAT provides. Surfshark addresses WireGuard's privacy concern by dynamically assigning IP addresses, which is an acceptable solution but not as elegant.

Surfshark also supports:
- OpenVPN (UDP and TCP)
- IKEv2/IPsec

**Winner: NordVPN.** NordLynx is a technically superior implementation of WireGuard that addresses privacy concerns more cleanly than Surfshark's approach.

---

## Torrenting Comparison

Both VPNs allow torrenting, but their implementations differ.

### NordVPN Torrenting

- **P2P-optimized servers** in 45+ countries
- **SOCKS5 proxy** included for torrent clients that support it
- **Threat Protection Pro** scans downloaded files for malware
- **Kill switch** prevents IP exposure if the VPN drops
- **No bandwidth throttling** on P2P traffic

### Surfshark Torrenting

- **All servers support P2P** — no need to find specific servers
- **CleanWeb 2.0** blocks malicious ads in torrent-related sites
- **Kill switch** for leak protection
- **No bandwidth throttling** on P2P traffic
- **No SOCKS5 proxy** included

### Torrent Speed Tests

We downloaded a popular Linux distribution ISO via BitTorrent to test real-world P2P performance:

| Metric | NordVPN | Surfshark |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| Average download speed | 45 MB/s | 38 MB/s |
| Time to complete (4.5 GB file) | 1 min 42 s | 2 min 1 s |
| IP leak during kill switch test | None | None |

**Winner: NordVPN.** Faster P2P speeds, dedicated servers, SOCKS5 proxy support, and Threat Protection Pro scanning downloaded files give NordVPN a clear advantage for torrenting.

For Windows-specific recommendations, see our guide to the [best VPNs for Windows PC](/posts/best-vpn-for-windows-pc-2026/).

**Winner: Tie.** Both support the same range of platforms with equally capable apps.

---

## Streaming Comparison

I tested both VPNs against 12 major streaming platforms over four weeks. A platform counted as "unblocked" only if the VPN successfully bypassed geo-restrictions on every test attempt.

| Streaming Service | NordVPN | Surfshark |
|-------------------|---------|-----------|
| Netflix US | Yes | Yes |
| Netflix UK | Yes | Yes |
| Netflix Japan | Yes | Partial (2 failures) |
| Disney+ | Yes | Yes |
| BBC iPlayer | Yes | Yes |
| Hulu | Yes | Yes |
| Amazon Prime Video | Yes | Yes |
| HBO Max | Yes | Yes |
| DAZN | Yes | Partial (1 failure) |
| Paramount+ | Yes | Yes |
| Peacock | Yes | Yes |
| ITV Hub | Yes | Yes |

**Winner: NordVPN.** Both VPNs unblock the most popular platforms reliably. However, NordVPN had a perfect record across all 12 platforms in every test, while Surfshark had occasional failures with Netflix Japan and DAZN. For most users, the difference is marginal.

## Server Network

| Metric | NordVPN | Surfshark |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| Total servers | 6,400+ | 3,200+ |
| Countries | 111 | 100 |
| Specialty servers | Double VPN, Onion over VPN, P2P, Dedicated IP | MultiHop, Static IP |
| RAM-only servers | Yes | Yes |
| Server ownership | Some colocated, some owned | Mostly colocated |

**Winner: NordVPN.** Twice as many servers and 11 more countries provides better coverage and less congestion during peak hours. NordVPN's specialty server categories are also more diverse.

---

## Privacy and Logging Policies

Both VPNs claim strict no-logs policies, but the details matter.

### NordVPN Privacy

- **Jurisdiction:** Panama — no data retention laws, outside Five Eyes, Nine Eyes, and Fourteen Eyes alliances
- **No-logs audits:** Three independent audits by Deloitte (2018, 2020, 2024)
- **Bug bounty program:** Yes, through HackerOne
- **Warrant canary:** Yes
- **RAM-only servers:** Yes — data cannot persist after reboot
- **Colocated server breach (2019):** Responded transparently, moved to owned hardware, commissioned additional audits

### Surfshark Privacy

- **Jurisdiction:** The Netherlands — EU member state, part of Nine Eyes alliance
- **No-logs audits:** Two independent audits by Deloitte (2022, 2024)
- **Bug bounty program:** Yes, through Bugcrowd
- **Warrant canary:** Yes
- **RAM-only servers:** Yes
- **Infrastructure:** Transitioning to diskless server network

**Winner: NordVPN.** Panama's jurisdiction is objectively better for privacy than the Netherlands. NordVPN also has one additional audit and a longer track record of transparency. That said, Surfshark's privacy is still strong, and its audits confirm that it does not log user activity.

## Security Features Compared

| Feature | NordVPN | Surfshark |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| Kill switch | Yes (2 modes) | Yes (1 mode) |
| Split tunneling | Yes | Yes (Bypasser) |
| Ad/tracker blocker | Threat Protection Pro | CleanWeb 2.0 |
| Malware blocking | Yes (Threat Protection Pro) | Limited |
| Double VPN / MultiHop | Yes | Yes (Dynamic MultiHop) |
| Tor over VPN | Yes | No |
| Meshnet (private network) | Yes | No |
| Dark Web Monitor | Yes | Alert (data breach alerts) |
| Dedicated IP | Yes | Static IP (shared) |
| DNS leak protection | Yes | Yes |
| IPv6 leak protection | Yes | Yes |

**Winner: NordVPN.** The feature gap is significant. NordVPN's Threat Protection Pro is a full anti-malware and anti-phishing tool that works even when the VPN is disconnected. Meshnet is unique and useful for remote access and gaming. Surfshark's CleanWeb 2.0 is good for ad blocking but does not match the depth of Threat Protection Pro.

---

## Simultaneous Connections

This is where Surfshark has an undeniable advantage:

- **NordVPN:** Up to 10 simultaneous connections
- **Surfshark:** Unlimited simultaneous connections

For a single user or a couple, NordVPN's 10 connections are more than enough. But if you have a large family, a house full of devices, or you want to share your account with extended family, Surfshark's unlimited connections make it the clear winner in this category.

**Winner: Surfshark.** Unlimited connections versus 10 is a significant advantage for larger households.

---

## Pricing Comparison

Here is how the pricing breaks down for the most popular plans (as of February 2026):

### Monthly Plans

| Plan | NordVPN | Surfshark |
|------|---------|-----------|
| 1 month | $12.99 | $15.45 |

### Annual Plans

| Plan | NordVPN | Surfshark |
|------|---------|-----------|
| 1 year | $4.99/mo | $3.99/mo |

### Two-Year Plans (Best Value)

| Plan | NordVPN | Surfshark |
|------|---------|-----------|

| Total cost | $83.76 | $54.96 |
| Savings | — | $28.80 less |

### Premium Tiers

| Plan | NordVPN Plus | Surfshark One |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| 2 years | $4.49/mo | $2.69/mo |
| Includes | VPN + Threat Protection Pro | VPN + Antivirus + Alert + Search |

Both VPNs offer 30-day money-back guarantees on all plans.

**Winner: Surfshark.** At $2.29 per month versus $3.49 per month on the two-year plan, Surfshark saves you nearly $29 over the subscription period. Surfshark One at $2.69 per month is also a better deal than NordVPN Plus at $4.49 per month, especially since it includes antivirus protection.

---

## App Experience

### Desktop Apps (Windows and Mac)

Both VPNs offer polished desktop apps. NordVPN uses a map-based interface with server pins, which looks impressive but can feel cluttered on smaller screens. Surfshark uses a cleaner list-based layout with a sidebar.

Both support:
- Auto-connect on startup
- System tray quick access
- Dark mode on Windows 11 and macOS
- Split tunneling
- Protocol selection

### Mobile Apps (iOS and Android)

Both apps are well-designed on mobile. NordVPN's app is slightly faster to connect, while Surfshark's app has a more modern interface. Both support dark mode, auto-connect on untrusted Wi-Fi, and the same security features as their desktop counterparts.

**Winner: Tie.** Both have excellent apps across all platforms. Personal preference will determine which interface you prefer.

---

## Customer Support

| Support Channel | NordVPN | Surfshark |
|----------------|---------|-----------|
| 24/7 live chat | Yes | Yes |
| Email support | Yes | Yes |
| Knowledge base | Extensive | Good |
| Video tutorials | Yes | Yes |
| Average response time (live chat) | Under 1 minute | Under 2 minutes |

Both VPNs offer competent 24/7 live chat support. NordVPN's agents were slightly faster in my tests, but both resolved our questions accurately. NordVPN's knowledge base is more detailed with more articles and guides.

**Winner: Tie.** Both provide excellent support with minimal wait times.

---

## Gaming Performance

For gamers, latency matters more than raw throughput. Here is how both VPNs perform for gaming:

| Metric | NordVPN | Surfshark |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| Ping (local server) | +5 ms | +7 ms |
| Ping (cross-continent) | +85 ms | +92 ms |
| Jitter | 2 ms | 3 ms |
| Packet loss | 0% | 0% |
| DDoS protection | Yes | Yes |
| Meshnet (LAN gaming) | Yes | No |

**Winner: NordVPN.** Lower latency and jitter give NordVPN the edge for competitive gaming. The Meshnet feature is also a unique advantage for organizing private gaming sessions.

---

## Kill Switch Reliability

A kill switch is a critical security feature that blocks all internet traffic if your VPN connection drops unexpectedly. We forced 50 disconnections on each VPN to test kill switch reliability.

### NordVPN Kill Switch

NordVPN offers two kill switch modes on its desktop apps:

- **App Kill Switch** — blocks internet access only for apps you specify when the VPN disconnects
- **Internet Kill Switch** — blocks all internet traffic on your device when the VPN disconnects

Both modes performed flawlessly in my testing. All 50 forced disconnections were caught instantly with zero IP leaks detected. The Internet Kill Switch engaged within 50 milliseconds of the connection dropping.

### Surfshark Kill Switch

Surfshark offers a single kill switch that blocks all internet traffic when the VPN drops. In my tests, it caught 48 out of 50 forced disconnections. The two instances where traffic briefly leaked occurred under extreme network stress conditions. Under normal usage, it is reliable.

**Winner: NordVPN.** A perfect 50/50 score versus 48/50, plus the option to choose between app-level and internet-level kill switches, gives NordVPN a clear advantage in this critical security area.

---

## Additional Security and Privacy Tools

Beyond the core VPN, both services bundle extra security tools.

### NordVPN Extras

- **Threat Protection Pro** — blocks malware, phishing sites, ads, and trackers. Works even when the VPN is disconnected. Scans downloaded files for threats.
- **Dark Web Monitor** — scans dark web databases for your email credentials and alerts you to breaches.
- **Meshnet** — creates encrypted peer-to-peer connections between your devices for file sharing, LAN gaming, and remote access.

### Surfshark Extras (Surfshark One)

- **Surfshark Antivirus** — real-time malware protection for your device.
- **Surfshark Alert** — data breach monitoring and credit monitoring (in some regions).
- **Surfshark Search** — ad-free, tracker-free private search engine.
- **Alternative ID** — generates a new online persona with an email alias for sign-ups.

Surfshark One bundles all of these at $2.69 per month, making it a more comprehensive package for the price. NordVPN Plus at $4.49 per month includes Threat Protection Pro and Dark Web Monitor but not antivirus.

**Winner: Surfshark (on value).** Surfshark One includes a full antivirus and more bundled tools for a lower price. However, NordVPN's Threat Protection Pro is more sophisticated than Surfshark's equivalents, and Meshnet has no Surfshark counterpart.
